Adjustments to the VVPR-bis regulation,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Law of January 21, 2022 regarding tax provisions (Belgian Official Gazette, January 28, 2022) has made a number of changes to the existing VVPR-bis regime.  This regime means that if certain conditions are met, dividends distributed by SME companies can benefit from a reduced withholding tax of 20% if they are distributed from the profit of the second financial year after that of the contribution and 15% if they are distributed from the profit of the third financial year. The amended regulation applies to <strong>dividends that are attributed or made payable as of 1 January 2022.</strong>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><br>
Pay-up obligation </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the conditions for the VVPR-bis regime is that the dividends must originate from new shares issued as from 1 July 2013 as compensation for a capital contribution <strong>paid up in cash</strong>. This pay-up must have been done at the time of the dividend payment.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following the entry into force of the new Company Code on May 1, 2019, the concept of 'capital' was abolished for a number of company forms. This has led to many private limited companies reducing their 'capital' to EUR 1 by, for example, an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The question then arose as to whether the capital of EUR 1 could continue to be classified as VVPR-bis capital and whether all dividends, including those from reserves prior to the capital reduction, could continue to benefit from the reduced withholding tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A ruling dated April 21, 2020 confirmed that the capital must be paid up at the time the dividend is attributed of paid “whereby the benefit of the reduced withholding tax cannot be denied due to the fact that the capital was not fully paid up at the time of conversion to a private limited company”. This meant that all future dividends could be paid out at the reduced rate and that the original contribution of EUR 18.550 did not have to be fully paid up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, this was beyond the reckoning of the government, which was of the opinion that the initially subscribed contribution must be fully paid up in order to be able to benefit from the VVPR-bis regime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The problem with this is that a company that has reduced its capital in the past, can never pay up its initial capital as it now only has EUR 1 capital.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That is why a <strong>temporary transitional regulation </strong>has now been introduced, which provides that companies that have reduced their contribution in good faith by means of an exemption from the pay up obligation between 1 May 2019 and 15 December 2021 , can still benefit from the VVPR-bis benefits, provided that they bring back their contribution to the initially subscribed amount by means of a cash contribution and this before 31 December 2022. This means that these companies will first have to carry out a new capital increase before being able to pay out dividends with application of the VVPR-bis benefits. Note that a later capital reduction does not constitute an obstacle to the VVPR-bis regime. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Waiting period </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The reduced withholding tax only applies after the expiry of a so-called waiting period.  Following the above, it has been determined that the waiting period to do a dividend payment is applicable on an ongoing basis<strong> as of the date of the initial contribution</strong> and not as of the date of the capital increase as previously envisaged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Non-preferential shares </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Another condition of the VVPR-bis regime is that the shares issued as a result of the contribution may not be preferential. In this regard, it is now stipulated that the shares may <strong>only be non-preferential with regard to the participation in the profits or the capital or the distribution of the equity</strong>.  Shares with multiple voting rights, on the other hand, are considered not to be preferential for the application of the VVPR-bis scheme.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In addition to the existing exclusions (for amounts contributed that originate from reserves 'locked up' in the past and amounts originating from a capital decrease in an affiliated or associated company), a new exclusion applies to amounts contributed that arise from a distribution of a liquidation reserve by an affiliated or associated company on which a reduced withholding tax of 5% was levied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
After a period of legal uncertainty in connection with a number of conditions for the application of the VVPR-bis regime, the Law of January 21, 2022 did introduce a number of clarifications.  Keeping the waiting period from the moment of the initial contribution is certainly one of them.  And also VVPR-bis companies that proceeded to an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full also know what to do before the end of the year.</p>

Student workers: everything you need to know,05/05/2023,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Student workers are <strong>an important part</strong> <strong>of the Belgian labour market</strong>. Every year, thousands of students work in <strong>various industries</strong>, such as retail and hospitality. With summer approaching, the number of students working will also increase again. Before employing students, it is essential to be aware of the relevant regulations and make the proper preparations. In this blog, we would like to give you the key points to consider when planning to employ students:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Age and study requirements</span></strong><span>: Working students in Belgium must be at least 15 years old. They must be enrolled as a student at an accredited educational institution, such as a high school, college or university. It is important to check students' proof of enrolment and make sure they meet these requirements.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2. </strong></span><strong>Working conditions and hours</strong>: As an employer, it is important to be aware of the specific working conditions and hours that apply to student workers. In Belgium, working students are allowed to work up to 600 hours per calendar year at a solidarity contribution (social security) on their gross pay of 2.71% for the student and 5.43% for the employer. In addition, no withholding tax is deducted from a student worker's pay. When a student works more than 600 hours, in principle, the normal rules that apply to any other employee in your company will apply. Thus, you will pay a higher employer's contribution on their gross pay, the social security contribution of 13.07% will apply, and the rules regarding withholding tax will apply.</p>
<p><span><strong>3. </strong></span><strong>Work on Sundays and public holidays:</strong> In principle, employees under 18 years of age may not be employed on Sundays or public holidays or work between 8pm and 6am. However, exceptions to this have been defined for certain sectors, such as the hospitality industry. For example, in the hospitality industry, young people under 18 are allowed to work on Sundays and public holidays every two weeks if they receive an extra day of rest in exchange. In the case of night work by a young person under the age of 18, there must be a continuous rest period of 12 hours between the end of the working day and the resumption of work the following day.</p>
<p><span><strong>4. </strong></span><strong>Employment contract:</strong> Student workers are required to have a written employment contract. This is regardless of the length of the employment contract. This contract must contain well-defined inforation, such as the duration of the contract, salary, working hours and job description. It is important to note that the first 3 working days of the contract are always considered probationary, even if there is no specific probation clause in the contract. During this period, both the employer and the student may terminate the contract without notice or compensation.</p>
<p><span><strong>5. </strong></span><strong>DIMONA declaration:</strong> As with other employees, it is required by law to file a DIMONA declaration before the start of employment. In the event of a late declaration for a student, the student cannot work as a student worker for the remainder of the quarter or until the end of the employment contract and is automatically treated as a regular employee by the NSSO.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>There are some situations in which a student is not eligible to work as a student worker:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Work experience of more than 12 months</span></strong><span>: If a student has already worked continuously with the same employer for more than 12 months, they can no longer work as a student worker with the same employer. However, they can still work as a student worker with another employer.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Mandatory school attendance</span></strong><span>: Working students may not have work hours at times when they are required to be present at school on a mandatory basis. This is to ensure that students have sufficient time for their studies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>School leavers after summer vacation</span></strong><span>: After 30 September, school leavers can no longer work as student workers. This gives them the opportunity to focus on finding full-time employment or further studies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Receiving unemployment benefits</span></strong><span>: If a student is receiving unemployment benefits, they cannot work as a student worker. This is because the student is considered actively seeking full-time employment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unpaid internships as part of a programme of study</strong><span>: If a student takes an unpaid internship as a required part of their programme of study, they cannot receive a student contract for this internship. In that case, different rules and guidelines apply to the internship.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Reduced curriculum or night school</span></strong><span>: If a student attends only night school or education with a reduced curriculum, restrictions or prohibitions may apply to working as a student worker. These rules may vary depending on the specific situation and educational institution.</span></li>
</ul>

Foreign real estate gets a cadastral income,30/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>You will remember the heated discussion that dragged on for several years. Belgian real estate belonging to natural persons that is not rented out or rented out for private purposes is taxed on the basis of the cadastral income (CI). Foreign real estate was taxed on the rental value or the rent received. In practice, depending on the country, all kinds of formulas appeared to determine this 'rental value'.</p>
<p>After being repeatedly condemned by Europe for this, Belgium has now (finally) amended its legislation (Law of 17 February 2021, Belgian Official Gazette of 25 February 2021).</p>
<h2>Attribution of a cadastral income</h2>
<p>From now on, all real estate located abroad will be assigned a CI and taxation will arise according to the same rules as for real estate located in Belgium. However, if the immovable property is located in a country with which Belgium has concluded a double tax treaty, the income thus determined remains (usually) exempt with progression. This means that it is only taken into account for determining the tax rate on the other income to be taxed in Belgium. For countries without a treaty, the tax is reduced to 50%.</p>
<p>The taxable base for non-rented or privately rented immovable property is then the indexed CI x 1,4. Where in the old scheme foreign tax could be deducted, this is no longer possible in the new scheme.</p>
<p>The latter also applies to other real estate (for instance rented to a company) that remains taxable on the basis of the net rent. This is the gross amount of rent received and the rental benefits less 10% lump sum expenses for land and 40% for built immovable property. However, this deduction is limited to 2/3 of the non-indexed CI x a revalorization coefficient. The consequence here is that the foreign tax is no longer deductible since it is deemed to be included in the lump sum expenses.</p>
<p>Another consequence is that a possible requalification of rent in remuneration for company directors is now also possible for foreign real estate.</p>
<h2>Determination of the cadastral income</h2>
<p>The CI is determined in the same way as the CI for Belgian immovable property i.e. on the basis of the normal net rental value on January 1, 1975.<br>
In practice, this is done as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For land: EUR 2,00 per hectare.</li>
<li>For buildings: by applying 5,3% on:
<ul>
<li>the normal sales value at the reference time (1 January 1975) or</li>
<li>if it is no longer possible to determine the normal sales value on 1 January 1975, the current normal sales value to which subsequently a correction factor is applied, which is determined per year. The correction factor is 15,018 for 2021 and 15,036 for 2020. The previous years can be found in Circular 2021/C/21 of 1 March 2021.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The normal sales value is then the sales value that can be obtained under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, a property purchased in 2021 with a current normal sales value of EUR 400.000 will have a CI of EUR 1.412 = 400.000 : 15,018 x 5,3%.</p>
<h2>Procedure and information to be provided</h2>
<p>If an immovable property is acquired as from 1 January 2021, this must be reported spontaneously to the authorities within 4 months of the acquisition. For goods acquired before that date, this must be done before 31 December 2021.</p>
<p>The declaration can be submitted via MyMinfin. The form can also be requested by e-mail on the following e-mail address: foreigncad@minfin.fed.be or by letter to the Administration of Measurements and Valuations , Cel Foreign Cadastral Income , Koning Albert II laan 33 box 55, 1030 Brussels. Taxpayers who had already declared foreign real estate income in their tax return in the past, in principle receive the form directly from the tax authorities.</p>
<p>The following information must, among other things, be included: type (villa, apartment), location, share of ownership, current sales value or price paid and year of purchase as well as any costs of construction or renovation works and the year they were completed. After the CI has been determined, this will be communicated by registered letter. An objection can then be lodged within 2 months.</p>
<p>Attention: not only the purchase, but also the sale, succession, rebuilding or any other change in your rights in rem of the foreign real estate, must be reported spontaneously.</p>
<h2>Sanction</h2>
<p>Taxpayers who fail to make the necessary notifications face a fine of EUR 250 to EUR 3.000.</p>
<h2>As from when does this apply?</h2>
<p>The newly determined CI will be taken into account in the personal income tax return as from tax year 2022 (income from 2021). For tax year 2021 (income from 2020), everything remains the same as now.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that the discrimination between Belgian and foreign real estate has been eliminated with the new regulation. Whether this will be in the taxpayer's advantage or disadvantage, however, remains to be seen.</p>

Overview of support measures in Belgium in the context of the corona crisis (Covid-19) - Update 30/03/2020,31/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>It is clear that the Coronavirus disrupts our society and economy. In order to limit the impact on businesses and self-employed persons, the Belgian government has issued an array of support measures. Below, we provide you with an overview of the different measures in the field of taxation, social security, (un)employment and the economy, as well as financing and guarantee schemes.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Tax</span></strong> <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of filing of tax returns:<br>
<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of Belgian VAT returns and Intra-Community sales listings:</span>
<p>- February 2020, term extended to April 6, 2020<br>
- March 2020, term extended to May 7, 2020<br>
- 1st quarter 2020, term extended to May 7, 2020 <br>

- If the VAT taxable person has terminated his activity: at the latest at the end of the 4th month after the cessation of his economic activity<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corporate, legal entities and non-resident (companies) income tax returns with a filing deadline from March 16 until April 30, 2020</span>
<p>Taxpayers receive an extension until midnight on Thursday, April 30, 2020 for filing corporate income tax, legal entities income tax and non-resident corporate income tax returns. This additional period only applies to tax returns with a final submission date from March 16 to April 30, 2020.<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of payment of taxes:</span></em>
<p>In addition to the automatic payment deferrals described below, any taxpayer affected by the Covid-19 crisis may request additional payment periods (payment plan), exemption from interest for late payment and / or cancellation of late payment penalties. This payment facility exists for VAT, corporate tax, non-resident tax, personal income tax and withholding tax and must be applied for no later than June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>Automatic deferral of payment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">VAT</span>
<p>An <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">automatic </span> extension of payment of two months for VAT without having to pay fines or interest. This deferral applies to the payment for the period:</p>
<p>- February 2020, payment term extended to May 20, 2020<br>
- March 2020, payment term extended to June 20, 2020<br>
- 1st quarter 2020, payment term extended to June 20, 2020<br>

</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Withholding tax on salaries</span>
<p><span>An <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">automatic </span> deferral of payment of two months for the withholding tax on salaries without having to pay fines or interests. This deferral applies to payment for the period:</span></p>
<p>- February 2020, payment term extended to May 13, 2020<br>
- March 2020, payment term extended to June 15, 2020<br>
- 1st quarter 2020, payment term extended to June 15, 2020 <br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corporate tax, legal entities tax, personal income tax and non-resident income tax </span>
<p>For the payment of personal and corporate income tax, the non-resident income tax and the legal entities tax, an additional period of 2 months will automatically be granted, in addition to the normal payment term, without interests for late payment being imposed. This measure applies to the settlement of taxes for tax year 2019, established from 12 March 2020</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of property tax for companies</span></em></li>
<p>With regard to property tax for companies, it was decided to issue the property tax assessments for companies at a later date in order to alleviate companies financially. The assessment notes will only be sent towards the end of 2020.</p>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Accelerated VAT refunds</span></em></li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>As of the VAT return of February 2020, all filers of monthly VAT returns can apply for a monthly VAT refund. Previously, this option was only available for license holders and start-up (during the first 24 months of activity). The accelerated VAT refunds do not apply for companies filing on a quarterly basis.
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Social security </span></strong>
<p><span>Measures for both companies and self-employed persons were announced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for companies:</span></em><br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li><strong><span>(Un)employment measures and support for the economy</span></strong>
<ul>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary unemployment:</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Although there are two types of temporary unemployment in Belgium, i.e. for economic reasons and in case of force majeure, a broad application of the concept of 'force majeure' will be accepted from 13 March 2020 (and for the entire duration of the governmental measures) and all situations of temporary unemployment by the coronavirus will be regarded as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even though it may be possible to work for several days. There is currently no prior notification, but this may become the case in the coming weeks. In the meantime, this government measure has been extended to 19 April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may apply to:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>blue collar workers and white-collar workers (from the private, public and non-profit sectors);</span></li>
<li><span>temporary workers during the term of their temporary employment contract (possibly renewable);</span></li>
<li><span>staff working in educational institutions;</span></li>
<li><span>students who follow an alternating course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure does not apply to:</span></p>
<ul>

<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extension of the PMV guarantee scheme</span></em>
<p><span>The Flemish regional government decided to expand the existing ""generic"" guarantee scheme, with an additional Coronavirus crisis guarantee of 100 million euros.

<p><span>Moreover, the cost of the guarantee for the entrepreneur is reduced with 50%, to 0.25%.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, under the Coronavirus crisis guarantee, bank debts (in addition to supplier debts) of existing credit lines and investment credits that have not yet been placed under guarantee can be guaranteed insofar as the bank is also prepared to allow a minimum of 3 months payment delay or maintain credit lines.

<p><span>In order to continue to ensure financing to private individuals, the self-employed and companies during this difficult period, the federal government has drawn up an agreement with the financial sector. This agreement consists of two pillars:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The financial sector is committed to defer payment to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed, as well as mortgage borrowers at risk of payment difficulties due to the corona crisis, until 30 September 2020;</span></li>
<li><span>The federal government will activate a guarantee scheme for all new credits and credit lines with a maximum term of 12 months, which will be provided by banks to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed.

Overview of support measures in Belgium in the context of the corona crisis (Covid-19) - Update 30/03/2020,31/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>It is clear that the Coronavirus disrupts our society and economy. In order to limit the impact on businesses and self-employed persons, the Belgian government has issued an array of support measures. Below, we provide you with an overview of the different measures in the field of taxation, social security, (un)employment and the economy, as well as financing and guarantee schemes.</span></p>

<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of payment of taxes:</span></em>
<p>In addition to the automatic payment deferrals described below, any taxpayer affected by the Covid-19 crisis may request additional payment periods (payment plan), exemption from interest for late payment and / or cancellation of late payment penalties. This payment facility exists for VAT, corporate tax, non-resident tax, personal income tax and withholding tax and must be applied for no later than June 30, 2020.</p>

This measure applies to the settlement of taxes for tax year 2019, established from 12 March 2020</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of property tax for companies</span></em></li>
<p>With regard to property tax for companies, it was decided to issue the property tax assessments for companies at a later date in order to alleviate companies financially. The assessment notes will only be sent towards the end of 2020.</p>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Accelerated VAT refunds</span></em></li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>As of the VAT return of February 2020, all filers of monthly VAT returns can apply for a monthly VAT refund. Previously, this option was only available for license holders and start-up (during the first 24 months of activity). The accelerated VAT refunds do not apply for companies filing on a quarterly basis.
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Social security </span></strong>
<p><span>Measures for both companies and self-employed persons were announced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for companies:</span></em><br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li><strong><span>(Un)employment measures and support for the economy</span></strong>
<ul>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary unemployment:</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Although there are two types of temporary unemployment in Belgium, i.e. for economic reasons and in case of force majeure, a broad application of the concept of 'force majeure' will be accepted from 13 March 2020 (and for the entire duration of the governmental measures) and all situations of temporary unemployment by the coronavirus will be regarded as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even though it may be possible to work for several days. There is currently no prior notification, but this may become the case in the coming weeks. In the meantime, this government measure has been extended to 19 April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may apply to:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>blue collar workers and white-collar workers (from the private, public and non-profit sectors);</span></li>
<li><span>temporary workers during the term of their temporary employment contract (possibly renewable);</span></li>
<li><span>staff working in educational institutions;</span></li>
<li><span>students who follow an alternating course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure does not apply to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>civil servants;</span></li>
<li><span>students;</span></li>
<li><span>full-time self-employed persons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, the following additional measures are taken to limit loss of income:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unemployment benefits are temporarily increased from 65% to 70% of the average capped salary (capped at EUR 2,754.76 per month);</span></li>
<li><span>Unemployment days are equated and included in the calculation of the holiday allowance; </span></li>
<li><span>The authorities (exceptionally) grant an extra amount of EUR 5.63 per day of unemployment on top of the unemployment benefit.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corona nuisance Subsidy (Flanders region):</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>

This is € 160 per mandatory closing day that coincides with a normal opening day. In the meantime, the government measures have been extended to April 19, 2020.</span></p>

Impact of Brexit on corporate taxation in Belgium,14/03/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>At the time of writing this article it looks like we are heading for a hard Brexit. This means that the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the European Union (EU).  What follows is an overview of the consequences of this in the field of corporate taxation in Belgium.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Impact on corporate taxation</em></strong></p>
<p><span>As the UK will no longer be part of the EU, the EU Directives will no longer apply. This means that Belgian companies in their relationship to the UK will no longer be able to rely on the guidelines included in the Directives in case these were not implemented in domestic law.  The tax treaty between Belgium and the UK will remain fully applicable.   </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Cross-border dividend distributions</em></strong></p>
<p><span>Brexit will not have much impact on cross-border dividend distributions between Belgium and the UK.  </span></p>
<p><span>According to the <em>Parent/Subsidiary Directive</em>, no withholding tax is due if certain conditions are met (minimum shareholding of at least 10%, held for at least 1 year). </span></p>
<p><span>In case the subsidiary is a Belgian company, Belgium will continue to apply the exemption of withholding tax on <strong>dividend distributions</strong> (provided the above conditions are met), since according to Belgian domestic law the exemption applies to all parent companies being tax resident in a country with which Belgium has concluded a tax treaty with a clause for the exchange of information, which is the case with the UK.</span></p>
<p><span>For <strong>dividends received</strong> by a Belgian parent company a dividend exemption applies if certain conditions are met (minimum shareholding of at least 10%, held for at least 1 year, the subsidiary meets the subject to tax requirement).   </span></p>
<p><span>Dividends from an EU subsidiary are fully exempt. If however the dividend comes from a non EU subsidiary, the exemption does not apply on some disallowed expenses.  </span></p>
<p><span>For dividends coming from a subsidiary in the EU, the subject to tax requirement is deemed to be met anyhow. However in case the dividend comes from a subsidiary in a non EU country, its nominal corporate income tax rate should at least be 15%, if not the exemption does not apply at all.  Although the nominal tax rate in the UK is actually 19% going down to 17% as from April 1, 2020, it has been announced that it will likely decrease further to less than 15%. It is not clear whether the equal treatment clause in the tax treaty between Belgium and the UK is broad enough so as to cover the dividend exemption after a rate decrease below 15%.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Cross-border interest and royalty payments</em></strong></p>
<p><span>The actual exemption of withholding tax based on the <em>Interest/Royalty Directive</em> would no longer apply but in this case the double tax treaty offers relief.</span></p>
<p><span>In case of cross-border interest and royalty payments between enterprises, there is an exemption provided certain formalities are fulfilled. The formalities however involve the intervention of the tax administration of both countries and increase the administrative burden. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Cross-border reorganisations</em></strong></p>
<p><span>Following the <em>Merger directive</em>, cross border reorganisations within the EU can, under certain conditions, be implemented in a tax neutral way. This is no longer possible when the UK is no part of the EU any more. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Other EU-Directives and regulations</em></strong></p>
<p><span>What about other EU-Directives like the ATAD Directive (Anti-Tax Avoidance) or the Directive for administrative cooperation and exchange of information? Or the draft Directive on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base or the measurements for taxation of the digital economy?</span></p>
<p><span>These will not apply (anymore).</span></p>
<p><strong><em>What if the UK would also no longer be part of the European Economic Area (EEA)</em></strong>?</p>
<p><span>In this case, a number of other measures are also compromised, amongst others:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>the newly introduced system of tax consolidation (applicable as from tax year 2020)</span></li>
<li>the off-setting of final losses of a permanent established in the UK against Belgian profits (as from tax year 2021)</li>
<li>the tax shelter regime</li>
<li>the possibility to pay the exit tax over 5 years</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>

Electronic invoicing,19/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Following the postponement of the introduction of mandatory <strong>electronic invoicing</strong> at the European level as part of the <strong>ViDA reforms</strong>, Belgium is implementing general mandatory electronic <strong>invoicing for B2B transactions from 1 January 2026</strong>.

Electronic invoicing,19/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Following the postponement of the introduction of mandatory <strong>electronic invoicing</strong> at the European level as part of the <strong>ViDA reforms</strong>, Belgium is implementing general mandatory electronic <strong>invoicing for B2B transactions from 1 January 2026</strong>. The move to mandatory electronic invoicing is important to reduce the VAT gap, the difference between what the government should receive in VAT revenue and what the government actually receives, and to further a reduction in the administrative burden for businesses.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What are the benefits of electronic invoicing?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span>E-invoicing is cheaper and faster.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">Faster invoicing results in faster payments and an improved cashflow for your company.</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">Incoming and outgoing invoices are recorded in the accounts immediately upon receipt or issuance of the invoices. This makes real-time accounting possible and the tool of choice to run your business.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 0cm;""> </p>
<p><span><strong>What impact will this change have?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span>Belgium has chosen to adopt the Peppol-Bis standard as its norm. An electronic PDF-format is no longer qualified as an electronic invoice ;</span></li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span></span>Electronic invoicing becomes mandatory for almost all taxpayers based in Belgium;</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">The new rules apply to local B2B transactions in Belgium. The new rules do not apply to B2C transactions. Rules on electronic invoicing already exist for B2G.</li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Necessary actions for companies?</strong></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Although<strong> the finance minister</strong> speaks of an ample transition period during which businesses can get ready for <strong>mandatory B2B electronic invoicing</strong>, it is advisable to take the necessary steps to implement the new rules in business procedures and systems as soon as possible. Specifically, enterprises should ensure that their ERP package or invoicing tool can <strong>send, receive and process electronic invoices</strong> in the <strong>Peppol-standard</strong>. Finally, the electronic archive must ensure the readability, integrity and authenticity of the electronic data throughout th<strong>e mandatory 10-year retention period</strong>.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>

Student workers: everything you need to know,05/05/2023,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Student workers are <strong>an important part</strong> <strong>of the Belgian labour market</strong>. Every year, thousands of students work in <strong>various industries</strong>, such as retail and hospitality. With summer approaching, the number of students working will also increase again. Before employing students, it is essential to be aware of the relevant regulations and make the proper preparations. In this blog, we would like to give you the key points to consider when planning to employ students:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Age and study requirements</span></strong><span>: Working students in Belgium must be at least 15 years old. They must be enrolled as a student at an accredited educational institution, such as a high school, college or university. It is important to check students' proof of enrolment and make sure they meet these requirements.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2. </strong></span><strong>Working conditions and hours</strong>: As an employer, it is important to be aware of the specific working conditions and hours that apply to student workers. In Belgium, working students are allowed to work up to 600 hours per calendar year at a solidarity contribution (social security) on their gross pay of 2.71% for the student and 5.43% for the employer. In addition, no withholding tax is deducted from a student worker's pay. When a student works more than 600 hours, in principle, the normal rules that apply to any other employee in your company will apply. Thus, you will pay a higher employer's contribution on their gross pay, the social security contribution of 13.07% will apply, and the rules regarding withholding tax will apply.</p>
<p><span><strong>3. </strong></span><strong>Work on Sundays and public holidays:</strong> In principle, employees under 18 years of age may not be employed on Sundays or public holidays or work between 8pm and 6am. However, exceptions to this have been defined for certain sectors, such as the hospitality industry. For example, in the hospitality industry, young people under 18 are allowed to work on Sundays and public holidays every two weeks if they receive an extra day of rest in exchange. In the case of night work by a young person under the age of 18, there must be a continuous rest period of 12 hours between the end of the working day and the resumption of work the following day.</p>
<p><span><strong>4. </strong></span><strong>Employment contract:</strong> Student workers are required to have a written employment contract. This is regardless of the length of the employment contract. This contract must contain well-defined inforation, such as the duration of the contract, salary, working hours and job description. It is important to note that the first 3 working days of the contract are always considered probationary, even if there is no specific probation clause in the contract. During this period, both the employer and the student may terminate the contract without notice or compensation.</p>
<p><span><strong>5. </strong></span><strong>DIMONA declaration:</strong> As with other employees, it is required by law to file a DIMONA declaration before the start of employment. In the event of a late declaration for a student, the student cannot work as a student worker for the remainder of the quarter or until the end of the employment contract and is automatically treated as a regular employee by the NSSO.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>There are some situations in which a student is not eligible to work as a student worker:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Work experience of more than 12 months</span></strong><span>: If a student has already worked continuously with the same employer for more than 12 months, they can no longer work as a student worker with the same employer. However, they can still work as a student worker with another employer.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Mandatory school attendance</span></strong><span>: Working students may not have work hours at times when they are required to be present at school on a mandatory basis. This is to ensure that students have sufficient time for their studies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>School leavers after summer vacation</span></strong><span>: After 30 September, school leavers can no longer work as student workers. This gives them the opportunity to focus on finding full-time employment or further studies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Receiving unemployment benefits</span></strong><span>: If a student is receiving unemployment benefits, they cannot work as a student worker. This is because the student is considered actively seeking full-time employment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unpaid internships as part of a programme of study</strong><span>: If a student takes an unpaid internship as a required part of their programme of study, they cannot receive a student contract for this internship. In that case, different rules and guidelines apply to the internship.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Reduced curriculum or night school</span></strong><span>: If a student attends only night school or education with a reduced curriculum, restrictions or prohibitions may apply to working as a student worker. These rules may vary depending on the specific situation and educational institution.</span></li>
</ul>

Mobility allowance versus mobility budget: what’s in a name?,01/04/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>In the context of striving for sustainable mobility, a number of measures have been introduced by the government that should be an attractive alternative to the company car.</span></p>
<p><span>The first concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility allowance</span> that was introduced as per January 1, 2018. This allowance offers employees the opportunity to trade in their company car for a monthly cash allowance = cash for car.</span></p>
<p><span>The second concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility budget</span> that is applicable as from March 1, 2019. The mobility budget means that an employee can trade in his company car up to a certain amount for a more environmentally friendly and cheaper car. The rest of the budget can then be spent on sustainable means of transport such as a subscription to public transport, a car sharing system, a bicycle allowance, etc. Any balance will be paid out in cash at the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that both measures apply, it is time for a comparative overview.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Comparison of both measures</em></strong></p>
<p><span>The award conditions are identical, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The employer must have made a company car available to at least one employee for at least 36 months.  Start-up companies that have not been in operation for 36 months can still offer the systems if they already have company cars in their pay packages for 12 months.</span></li>
<li><span>The employee must have been entitled to a company car for at least 12 months in the 36 months prior to the application, of which at least 3 months must be uninterrupted before the application.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>However, they do not apply when an employee is recruited or promoted or in case of a function change before 1 March 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, neither of these measures are mandatory: the employer is not required to offer them and the employee is not required to accept them!</span></p>
<p><span>The main differences are in the following areas:</span></p>

Company cars and income tax in 2020: be prepared!,13/12/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">As from January 1, 2020 there will be some important changes regarding the taxation of company cars.  Both the calculation of the tax deductible percentage for corporate tax purposes as well as the calculation of the benefit in kind for hybrid cars are amended.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Tax deductible percentage</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Until the end of 2019, the tax deduction is determined on the basis of the CO2 emission of the car taking into account the kind of fuel, leading to a tax deduction between 50% and 120%. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">As from January 1, 2020, the tax deduction will be calculated according to the following formula:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""border:0.5pt solid #000000;margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt; padding: 1pt 4pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Basis of 120 - (50% of (CO2 emission x correction percentage)) = deductible percentage</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The correction percentages are 95% for a car on gasoline and 90% for a car on CNG if the fiscal HP stays under 12.   The deduction percentage cannot fall below 40%, nor can it exceed 100%. The favourable 120% deduction for electric cars expires. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The new formula will also apply on the fuel costs where they were tax deductible for 75% before. </span></p>

Adjustments to the VVPR-bis regulation,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Law of January 21, 2022 regarding tax provisions (Belgian Official Gazette, January 28, 2022) has made a number of changes to the existing VVPR-bis regime.  This regime means that if certain conditions are met, dividends distributed by SME companies can benefit from a reduced withholding tax of 20% if they are distributed from the profit of the second financial year after that of the contribution and 15% if they are distributed from the profit of the third financial year. The amended regulation applies to <strong>dividends that are attributed or made payable as of 1 January 2022.</strong>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><br>
Pay-up obligation </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the conditions for the VVPR-bis regime is that the dividends must originate from new shares issued as from 1 July 2013 as compensation for a capital contribution <strong>paid up in cash</strong>. This pay-up must have been done at the time of the dividend payment.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following the entry into force of the new Company Code on May 1, 2019, the concept of 'capital' was abolished for a number of company forms. This has led to many private limited companies reducing their 'capital' to EUR 1 by, for example, an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The question then arose as to whether the capital of EUR 1 could continue to be classified as VVPR-bis capital and whether all dividends, including those from reserves prior to the capital reduction, could continue to benefit from the reduced withholding tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A ruling dated April 21, 2020 confirmed that the capital must be paid up at the time the dividend is attributed of paid “whereby the benefit of the reduced withholding tax cannot be denied due to the fact that the capital was not fully paid up at the time of conversion to a private limited company”. This meant that all future dividends could be paid out at the reduced rate and that the original contribution of EUR 18.550 did not have to be fully paid up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, this was beyond the reckoning of the government, which was of the opinion that the initially subscribed contribution must be fully paid up in order to be able to benefit from the VVPR-bis regime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The problem with this is that a company that has reduced its capital in the past, can never pay up its initial capital as it now only has EUR 1 capital.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That is why a <strong>temporary transitional regulation </strong>has now been introduced, which provides that companies that have reduced their contribution in good faith by means of an exemption from the pay up obligation between 1 May 2019 and 15 December 2021 , can still benefit from the VVPR-bis benefits, provided that they bring back their contribution to the initially subscribed amount by means of a cash contribution and this before 31 December 2022. This means that these companies will first have to carry out a new capital increase before being able to pay out dividends with application of the VVPR-bis benefits. Note that a later capital reduction does not constitute an obstacle to the VVPR-bis regime. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Waiting period </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The reduced withholding tax only applies after the expiry of a so-called waiting period.  Following the above, it has been determined that the waiting period to do a dividend payment is applicable on an ongoing basis<strong> as of the date of the initial contribution</strong> and not as of the date of the capital increase as previously envisaged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Non-preferential shares </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Another condition of the VVPR-bis regime is that the shares issued as a result of the contribution may not be preferential. In this regard, it is now stipulated that the shares may <strong>only be non-preferential with regard to the participation in the profits or the capital or the distribution of the equity</strong>.  Shares with multiple voting rights, on the other hand, are considered not to be preferential for the application of the VVPR-bis scheme.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In addition to the existing exclusions (for amounts contributed that originate from reserves 'locked up' in the past and amounts originating from a capital decrease in an affiliated or associated company), a new exclusion applies to amounts contributed that arise from a distribution of a liquidation reserve by an affiliated or associated company on which a reduced withholding tax of 5% was levied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
After a period of legal uncertainty in connection with a number of conditions for the application of the VVPR-bis regime, the Law of January 21, 2022 did introduce a number of clarifications.  Keeping the waiting period from the moment of the initial contribution is certainly one of them.  And also VVPR-bis companies that proceeded to an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full also know what to do before the end of the year.</p>

Belgian Summerplan,10/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">As you may have already heard, a number of relaxations will again take effect as of Wednesday 9th of June 2021.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;""> </p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">These relaxations are part of the first step in the ""Summer Plan"". </p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">We have listed the most important changes for you.</p>
<h2> Return to the workplace</h2>
<p>
Since the previous consultation committee, it has been permitted for employers to organize <strong>'return moments'</strong>. In concrete terms, these are moments when employees who have been doing <strong>compulsory telework</strong> in the past few months can come back to the office. Note that teleworking is still compulsory until the <strong>1<sup>st</sup> of July 2021</strong>.</p>
<p>
These return moments do have a number of mandatory conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>These moments are allowed for a maximum of 20% of the employees at the same time and for one day a week.
</li>
<li> In companies with less than 10 employees, a maximum of 5 employees may be present at the same time. However, testing of employees is strongly recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>
Employees returning from holidays abroad </h2>
<p>The rules below only apply as of the 1st of July 2021. Until that date, the current measures remain in force. </p>
<p>Employees can travel freely within the European Union if they have a <strong>digital corona certificate</strong>. 
This certificate is proof that someone has been vaccinated against corona, has tested negative, or has recently recovered from corona. <strong>The Passenger Location Form</strong> (PLF) is still compulsory, but the distinction between private and business travel has been removed. Therefore, it is no longer mandatory for business trips to complete the Business Travel Brad tool, but the PLF must be completed.</p>
<p>The quarantine rules regarding travel will also be adjusted:</p>
<ul>
<li>When your employees return from a green or orange zone, they are not required to go into quarantine or be tested. </li>
<li>When your employees return from a red zone, they do not have to go into quarantine after returning, provided they have a digital corona certificate or a recent PCR test.
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Foreign Workers</h2>
<p>If, as an employer, you employ foreign workers, the same rules apply. However, other rules apply if your employees come from countries that are not members of the European Union:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign employees who come from outside the European Union must be fully vaccinated (+ 2 weeks) with a vaccine recognized by Europe and take a PCR test on the day of arrival. If the test is negative, this employee does not have to go into quarantine.</li>
<li>An entry ban applies to foreign employees who come from or have stayed in a very high-risk area (""Variants of concern""). Exceptions are made for essential travel by transport personnel and diplomats. They must undergo a 10-day mandatory quarantine with a PCR test on day 1 and day 7. The quarantine may only be interrupted for an essential reason.
</li>
</ul>

Electronic invoicing,19/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Following the postponement of the introduction of mandatory <strong>electronic invoicing</strong> at the European level as part of the <strong>ViDA reforms</strong>, Belgium is implementing general mandatory electronic <strong>invoicing for B2B transactions from 1 January 2026</strong>. The move to mandatory electronic invoicing is important to reduce the VAT gap, the difference between what the government should receive in VAT revenue and what the government actually receives, and to further a reduction in the administrative burden for businesses.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What are the benefits of electronic invoicing?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span>E-invoicing is cheaper and faster.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">Faster invoicing results in faster payments and an improved cashflow for your company.</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">Incoming and outgoing invoices are recorded in the accounts immediately upon receipt or issuance of the invoices. This makes real-time accounting possible and the tool of choice to run your business.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 0cm;""> </p>
<p><span><strong>What impact will this change have?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span>Belgium has chosen to adopt the Peppol-Bis standard as its norm. An electronic PDF-format is no longer qualified as an electronic invoice ;</span></li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span></span>Electronic invoicing becomes mandatory for almost all taxpayers based in Belgium;</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">The new rules apply to local B2B transactions in Belgium. The new rules do not apply to B2C transactions. Rules on electronic invoicing already exist for B2G.</li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Necessary actions for companies?</strong></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Although<strong> the finance minister</strong> speaks of an ample transition period during which businesses can get ready for <strong>mandatory B2B electronic invoicing</strong>, it is advisable to take the necessary steps to implement the new rules in business procedures and systems as soon as possible. Specifically, enterprises should ensure that their ERP package or invoicing tool can <strong>send, receive and process electronic invoices</strong> in the <strong>Peppol-standard</strong>. Finally, the electronic archive must ensure the readability, integrity and authenticity of the electronic data throughout th<strong>e mandatory 10-year retention period</strong>.</span></p>

Mobility allowance versus mobility budget: what’s in a name?,01/04/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>In the context of striving for sustainable mobility, a number of measures have been introduced by the government that should be an attractive alternative to the company car.</span></p>
<p><span>The first concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility allowance</span> that was introduced as per January 1, 2018. This allowance offers employees the opportunity to trade in their company car for a monthly cash allowance = cash for car.</span></p>
<p><span>The second concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility budget</span> that is applicable as from March 1, 2019. The mobility budget means that an employee can trade in his company car up to a certain amount for a more environmentally friendly and cheaper car. The rest of the budget can then be spent on sustainable means of transport such as a subscription to public transport, a car sharing system, a bicycle allowance, etc. Any balance will be paid out in cash at the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that both measures apply, it is time for a comparative overview.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Comparison of both measures</em></strong></p>
<p><span>The award conditions are identical, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The employer must have made a company car available to at least one employee for at least 36 months.  Start-up companies that have not been in operation for 36 months can still offer the systems if they already have company cars in their pay packages for 12 months.</span></li>
<li><span>The employee must have been entitled to a company car for at least 12 months in the 36 months prior to the application, of which at least 3 months must be uninterrupted before the application.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>However, they do not apply when an employee is recruited or promoted or in case of a function change before 1 March 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, neither of these measures are mandatory: the employer is not required to offer them and the employee is not required to accept them!</span></p>
<p><span>The main differences are in the following areas:</span></p>

Company cars and income tax in 2020: be prepared!,13/12/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">As from January 1, 2020 there will be some important changes regarding the taxation of company cars.  Both the calculation of the tax deductible percentage for corporate tax purposes as well as the calculation of the benefit in kind for hybrid cars are amended.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Tax deductible percentage</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Until the end of 2019, the tax deduction is determined on the basis of the CO2 emission of the car taking into account the kind of fuel, leading to a tax deduction between 50% and 120%. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">As from January 1, 2020, the tax deduction will be calculated according to the following formula:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""border:0.5pt solid #000000;margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt; padding: 1pt 4pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Basis of 120 - (50% of (CO2 emission x correction percentage)) = deductible percentage</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The correction percentages are 95% for a car on gasoline and 90% for a car on CNG if the fiscal HP stays under 12.   The deduction percentage cannot fall below 40%, nor can it exceed 100%. The favourable 120% deduction for electric cars expires. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The new formula will also apply on the fuel costs where they were tax deductible for 75% before. </span></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">First let’s consider the concept of hybrid or fake-hybrid.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">A </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">plug-in hybrid</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> is considered to be a hybrid for tax purposes if the CO2 emission is a maximum of 50 grams </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">and</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> the battery capacity exceeds 0.5 KWH per 100 kg. The bigger the battery, the better. With this rule, all large and heavier cars almost certainly fall into the fake hybrid category. A </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">full hybrid</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">, one without a plug, is always a tax hybrid. This rule applies to all hybrid cars that were purchased after 1/1/2018.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Until now, the CO2 emission stated on the registration certificate is used to calculate the benefit in kind. This is the NEDC value for the vehicle including the hybrid module. In almost all cases, this was a low value with a favourable benefit in kind.  From 2020, however, it will be necessary to verify whether or not the hybrid is fake. With a fake hybrid we have to use the CO2 value of a similar fuel engine without the hybrid module. If this is not available, we must multiply the CO2 emission by 2.5.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">NEDC, NEDC 2.0 and WLTP CO2 emission standards</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The CO2 emission has been expressed in a NEDC value for a long time. This was a theoretical value which came under pressure after the Diesel gate because it was not realistic enough. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">From September 1, 2018, a new WLTP standard was introduced that would be more truthful. Because cars from before this date have no WLTP emissions, a NEDC 2.0 has been created to make older cars more compatible with the WLTP standard.  In practice, the WLTP standard is in almost all cases higher than the NEDC standard.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Both the Flemish government and the Federal government have confirmed that the NEDC standard will be applied up to and including 2020. From 2021, the WLTP emissions will have to be used in taxation, although it is not yet clear whether this rule applies suddenly to all cars or only to those registered after 1/1/2021. </span></p>

Overview of support measures in Belgium in the context of the corona crisis (Covid-19) - Update 30/03/2020,31/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>It is clear that the Coronavirus disrupts our society and economy.

<br>
</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of payment of taxes:</span></em>
<p>In addition to the automatic payment deferrals described below, any taxpayer affected by the Covid-19 crisis may request additional payment periods (payment plan), exemption from interest for late payment and / or cancellation of late payment penalties. This payment facility exists for VAT, corporate tax, non-resident tax, personal income tax and withholding tax and must be applied for no later than June 30, 2020.</p>

This measure applies to the settlement of taxes for tax year 2019, established from 12 March 2020</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of property tax for companies</span></em></li>
<p>With regard to property tax for companies, it was decided to issue the property tax assessments for companies at a later date in order to alleviate companies financially. The assessment notes will only be sent towards the end of 2020.</p>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Accelerated VAT refunds</span></em></li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>As of the VAT return of February 2020, all filers of monthly VAT returns can apply for a monthly VAT refund. Previously, this option was only available for license holders and start-up (during the first 24 months of activity). The accelerated VAT refunds do not apply for companies filing on a quarterly basis.
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Social security </span></strong>
<p><span>Measures for both companies and self-employed persons were announced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for companies:</span></em><br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li><strong><span>(Un)employment measures and support for the economy</span></strong>
<ul>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary unemployment:</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Although there are two types of temporary unemployment in Belgium, i.e. for economic reasons and in case of force majeure, a broad application of the concept of 'force majeure' will be accepted from 13 March 2020 (and for the entire duration of the governmental measures) and all situations of temporary unemployment by the coronavirus will be regarded as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even though it may be possible to work for several days. There is currently no prior notification, but this may become the case in the coming weeks. In the meantime, this government measure has been extended to 19 April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may apply to:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>blue collar workers and white-collar workers (from the private, public and non-profit sectors);</span></li>
<li><span>temporary workers during the term of their temporary employment contract (possibly renewable);</span></li>
<li><span>staff working in educational institutions;</span></li>
<li><span>students who follow an alternating course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure does not apply to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>civil servants;</span></li>
<li><span>students;</span></li>
<li><span>full-time self-employed persons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, the following additional measures are taken to limit loss of income:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unemployment benefits are temporarily increased from 65% to 70% of the average capped salary (capped at EUR 2,754.76 per month);</span></li>
<li><span>Unemployment days are equated and included in the calculation of the holiday allowance; </span></li>
<li><span>The authorities (exceptionally) grant an extra amount of EUR 5.63 per day of unemployment on top of the unemployment benefit.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corona nuisance Subsidy (Flanders region):</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Businesses affected by a mandatory closure receive a one-off premium of € 4,000. If additional mandatory closing measures extend the closing period after April 5, 2020, the company will receive an additional closing premium from its location for each additional closing day. This is € 160 per mandatory closing day that coincides with a normal opening day. In the meantime, the government measures have been extended to April 19, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>The Corona nuisance Subsidy can be applied for online until 5 May 2020 at <a href=""http://www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be</span></a>. The required information is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>an e-id and e-id pin code or another digital key (itsme, ...).</span></li>
<li><span>An active Belgian account number of your company (IBAN format).</span></li>
<li><span>the regular opening days, as applicable before the Coronavirus measures.</span></li>
<li><span>The website address (url) of your company.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">• Flexibility in the execution of federal public procurement</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>For all public procurement government contracts for which can be proven that they are delayed or non-executed due to the Coronavirus crisis, the federal government will not impose fines or sanctions on service providers, companies or self-employed contractors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Loans and guarantees</span></strong></li>
<p> </p>
</ol><ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extension of the PMV guarantee scheme</span></em>
<p><span>The Flemish regional government decided to expand the existing ""generic"" guarantee scheme, with an additional Coronavirus crisis guarantee of 100 million euros. Via the Coronavirus guarantee scheme companies and self-employed persons can guarantee bridging loans for up to 12 months for existing non-bank debts, while this is only possible for up to 3 months for the existing guarantee scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the cost of the guarantee for the entrepreneur is reduced with 50%, to 0.25%.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, under the Coronavirus crisis guarantee, bank debts (in addition to supplier debts) of existing credit lines and investment credits that have not yet been placed under guarantee can be guaranteed insofar as the bank is also prepared to allow a minimum of 3 months payment delay or maintain credit lines. As such, the crisis guarantee serves as a catalyst for a flexible banking policy towards companies.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The federal government and financial sector reach an agreement to facilitate lending to private individuals, the self-employed and companies </span></em>
<p><span>In order to continue to ensure financing to private individuals, the self-employed and companies during this difficult period, the federal government has drawn up an agreement with the financial sector. This agreement consists of two pillars:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The financial sector is committed to defer payment to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed, as well as mortgage borrowers at risk of payment difficulties due to the corona crisis, until 30 September 2020;</span></li>
<li><span>The federal government will activate a guarantee scheme for all new credits and credit lines with a maximum term of 12 months, which will be provided by banks to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed. The purpose of this guarantee scheme is to maintain the financing of the Belgian economy.<br>
<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Insurance sector </span></em></li>
<p><span>For companies, a number of insurance policies (accidents at work, civil liability, etc.) already offer the option of adjusting the premium afterwards if there is a reduction in activity. This will be adjusted automatically. In addition, companies that are required to shut down their activities can obtain deferral of payment of their premium for all premiums that expire between March 30 and September 30 in consultation with their insurer. Finally, the same extension of payment will be applied on loans granted to companies as granted by the banking sector (until 30 September 2020). </span></p>

The exempt reconstruction reserve,28/05/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">In order to absorb the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the equity of companies and to restore their solvency, the reconstruction reserve was announced in the spring of 2020 as one of the measures to give companies more financial breathing space. Ultimately, the reserve was approved by the law of November 19, 2020, which introduced a new article 194quater/1 in the 1992 CIR</p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">The reconstruction reserve offers companies the option, under certain conditions, to create an exempt reserve in the assessment years 2022, 2023 and / or 2024 up to the amount of the loss they incurred in the financial year ending in 2020 (in some cases, for the financial year that closes in 2021) with an absolute maximum of 20 million euros.</p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Which losses?</h3>
<p>The reconstruction reserve is created on the basis of the business operating loss that was incurred in the financial year closed in 2020. There does not need to be a tax loss. It is irrelevant whether or not the losses were incurred as a result of the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>Companies whose financial year closes between January 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020, have the choice to take into account the loss of the financial year closed in 2020 or that of the financial year closed in 2021.</p>
<h3>Creation of the reserve</h3>
<p>The reconstruction reserve is created per taxable period associated with the assessment years 2022, 2023 and/or 2024 to the amount of the taxable reserved profit before the reconstruction reserve is created.</p>
<p><em>Example: a company has an accounting loss of EUR 100.000 as at 31 December 2020. As from assessment year 2022 up to and including assessment year 2024, it can create a reconstruction reserve of a maximum of EUR 100,000 in function of its taxable reserved profit before the reconstruction reserve for the financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023.</em></p>
<p>The created reserve must further meet the ""intangibility condition"" and must be booked in one or more separate accounts on the liabilities’ side of the annual accounts.</p>
<h3>Retention and reversal of the exemption</h3>
<p>However, the created reconstruction reserve becomes taxable to the extent that the company makes distributions from its equity or when its employment level falls, and this at any time after the reconstruction reserve has been created. At the latest at the time of the liquidation of the company, the part of the reconstruction reserve that has not yet been taxed becomes taxable.</p>
<h3>Equity distributions</h3>
<div>Any distribution or allotment since the creation of the reconstruction reserve up to the liquidation of the company gives rise to a taxable reversal of the established reserve. More specifically, it concerns the following transactions:</div>
<ul>
<li>Repurchase of own shares: reversal up to the value of the shares repurchased at the time of repurchase;</li>
<li>Allocation or distribution of dividends: reversal of the amount of the allocated or distributed dividend;</li>
<li>Capital decrease (including the repayment of locked-in reserves) or ""any other decrease"" in equity: reversal of the amount of the decrease; here ""any other reduction"" is broadly interpreted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decline in employment level</h3>
<p>
The personnel costs in the 62 account must be maintained at at least 85% of the amount in that account for the financial year that ended in 2019. If this is not the case, the difference between that 85% and the amount of the financial year concerned becomes taxable. The latter amount then becomes the new threshold value for the following fiscal years. The ""remuneration test"" must be done every year.<br>
<br>
The taxable part of the reconstruction reserve can be offset against all tax deductions that the company would have at its disposal.</p>
<h3>Which companies?</h3>
<p>
In principle, ALL companies that are subject to corporate tax or non-resident corporate tax are eligible. The measure is therefore not limited to SMEs. Obviously, the company must have incurred a loss in the ""Covid year"".<br>
However, the following companies are excluded in any case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies that were already in difficulties on March 18, 2020 (including companies in liquidation);</li>
<li>Companies that, in the period from March 12, 2020 up to the date of submission of their corporate income tax return in which the reserve is set up, have repurchased own shares, paid dividends, have implemented a capital reduction or have conducted any other reduction in capital or equity;</li>
<li>Investment companies, regulated real estate companies, cooperative private equity firms and shipping companies subject to tonnage tax;</li>
<li>Companies that have a direct participation in a company in a tax haven or that make payments to such companies of at least EUR 100,000 unless these payments meet legitimate financial or economic needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concurrence with other favourable tax measures</h3>
<p>
The reconstruction reserve does not affect the tax losses incurred in the Covid year. It is not because these have (partly) been the subject of the reconstruction reserve that they are no longer tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reserve can be created together with the application of the carry-back system of losses or with the system of fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it has a negative impact on the amount of the taxable retained profit, which means that it can influence the interest deduction limitation or the tax shelter for audio-visual works or stage productions as these are based / limited in function of the amount of the taxable retained profit..</p>
<h3>Other formalities</h3>
<p>
For the tax years in which the exemption is applied, the company must add a form to its tax return that will be determined.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The introduction of the Reconstruction Reserve offers help to companies that have suffered business losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic and can provide financial breathing room.<br>
However, there are many conditions attached to this and the remuneration test requires that it must be followed up annually..</p>

Overview of support measures in Belgium in the context of the corona crisis (Covid-19) - Update 30/03/2020,31/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>It is clear that the Coronavirus disrupts our society and economy. In order to limit the impact on businesses and self-employed persons, the Belgian government has issued an array of support measures. Below, we provide you with an overview of the different measures in the field of taxation, social security, (un)employment and the economy, as well as financing and guarantee schemes.</span></p>

<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corporate, legal entities and non-resident (companies) income tax returns with a filing deadline from March 16 until April 30, 2020</span>
<p>Taxpayers receive an extension until midnight on Thursday, April 30, 2020 for filing corporate income tax, legal entities income tax and non-resident corporate income tax returns. This additional period only applies to tax returns with a final submission date from March 16 to April 30, 2020.<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of payment of taxes:</span></em>
<p>In addition to the automatic payment deferrals described below, any taxpayer affected by the Covid-19 crisis may request additional payment periods (payment plan), exemption from interest for late payment and / or cancellation of late payment penalties. This payment facility exists for VAT, corporate tax, non-resident tax, personal income tax and withholding tax and must be applied for no later than June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>Automatic deferral of payment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">VAT</span>
<p>An <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">automatic </span> extension of payment of two months for VAT without having to pay fines or interest. This deferral applies to the payment for the period:</p>

<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corporate tax, legal entities tax, personal income tax and non-resident income tax </span>
<p>For the payment of personal and corporate income tax, the non-resident income tax and the legal entities tax, an additional period of 2 months will automatically be granted, in addition to the normal payment term, without interests for late payment being imposed. This measure applies to the settlement of taxes for tax year 2019, established from 12 March 2020</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of property tax for companies</span></em></li>
<p>With regard to property tax for companies, it was decided to issue the property tax assessments for companies at a later date in order to alleviate companies financially. The assessment notes will only be sent towards the end of 2020.</p>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Accelerated VAT refunds</span></em></li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>As of the VAT return of February 2020, all filers of monthly VAT returns can apply for a monthly VAT refund. Previously, this option was only available for license holders and start-up (during the first 24 months of activity). The accelerated VAT refunds do not apply for companies filing on a quarterly basis.
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Social security </span></strong>
<p><span>Measures for both companies and self-employed persons were announced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for companies:</span></em><br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li><strong><span>(Un)employment measures and support for the economy</span></strong>
<ul>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary unemployment:</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Although there are two types of temporary unemployment in Belgium, i.e. for economic reasons and in case of force majeure, a broad application of the concept of 'force majeure' will be accepted from 13 March 2020 (and for the entire duration of the governmental measures) and all situations of temporary unemployment by the coronavirus will be regarded as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even though it may be possible to work for several days. There is currently no prior notification, but this may become the case in the coming weeks. In the meantime, this government measure has been extended to 19 April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may apply to:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>blue collar workers and white-collar workers (from the private, public and non-profit sectors);</span></li>
<li><span>temporary workers during the term of their temporary employment contract (possibly renewable);</span></li>
<li><span>staff working in educational institutions;</span></li>
<li><span>students who follow an alternating course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure does not apply to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>civil servants;</span></li>
<li><span>students;</span></li>
<li><span>full-time self-employed persons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, the following additional measures are taken to limit loss of income:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unemployment benefits are temporarily increased from 65% to 70% of the average capped salary (capped at EUR 2,754.76 per month);</span></li>
<li><span>Unemployment days are equated and included in the calculation of the holiday allowance; </span></li>
<li><span>The authorities (exceptionally) grant an extra amount of EUR 5.63 per day of unemployment on top of the unemployment benefit.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corona nuisance Subsidy (Flanders region):</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Businesses affected by a mandatory closure receive a one-off premium of € 4,000. If additional mandatory closing measures extend the closing period after April 5, 2020, the company will receive an additional closing premium from its location for each additional closing day. This is € 160 per mandatory closing day that coincides with a normal opening day. In the meantime, the government measures have been extended to April 19, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>The Corona nuisance Subsidy can be applied for online until 5 May 2020 at <a href=""http://www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be</span></a>. The required information is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>an e-id and e-id pin code or another digital key (itsme, ...).</span></li>
<li><span>An active Belgian account number of your company (IBAN format).</span></li>
<li><span>the regular opening days, as applicable before the Coronavirus measures.</span></li>
<li><span>The website address (url) of your company.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">• Flexibility in the execution of federal public procurement</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>For all public procurement government contracts for which can be proven that they are delayed or non-executed due to the Coronavirus crisis, the federal government will not impose fines or sanctions on service providers, companies or self-employed contractors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Loans and guarantees</span></strong></li>
<p> </p>
</ol><ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extension of the PMV guarantee scheme</span></em>
<p><span>The Flemish regional government decided to expand the existing ""generic"" guarantee scheme, with an additional Coronavirus crisis guarantee of 100 million euros. Via the Coronavirus guarantee scheme companies and self-employed persons can guarantee bridging loans for up to 12 months for existing non-bank debts, while this is only possible for up to 3 months for the existing guarantee scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the cost of the guarantee for the entrepreneur is reduced with 50%, to 0.25%.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, under the Coronavirus crisis guarantee, bank debts (in addition to supplier debts) of existing credit lines and investment credits that have not yet been placed under guarantee can be guaranteed insofar as the bank is also prepared to allow a minimum of 3 months payment delay or maintain credit lines. As such, the crisis guarantee serves as a catalyst for a flexible banking policy towards companies.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The federal government and financial sector reach an agreement to facilitate lending to private individuals, the self-employed and companies </span></em>
<p><span>In order to continue to ensure financing to private individuals, the self-employed and companies during this difficult period, the federal government has drawn up an agreement with the financial sector. This agreement consists of two pillars:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The financial sector is committed to defer payment to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed, as well as mortgage borrowers at risk of payment difficulties due to the corona crisis, until 30 September 2020;</span></li>
<li><span>The federal government will activate a guarantee scheme for all new credits and credit lines with a maximum term of 12 months, which will be provided by banks to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed. The purpose of this guarantee scheme is to maintain the financing of the Belgian economy.<br>
<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Insurance sector </span></em></li>
<p><span>For companies, a number of insurance policies (accidents at work, civil liability, etc.) already offer the option of adjusting the premium afterwards if there is a reduction in activity. This will be adjusted automatically. In addition, companies that are required to shut down their activities can obtain deferral of payment of their premium for all premiums that expire between March 30 and September 30 in consultation with their insurer. Finally, the same extension of payment will be applied on loans granted to companies as granted by the banking sector (until 30 September 2020). </span></p>

<p><span>For any further measures regarding suspension of contracts, both private individuals and companies are advised to contact their insurer or broker directly. </span></p>
</ul>

<p><span>Several additional support measures are still under negotiation/debate. We will of course keep you informed of any updates in this regard.</span></p>

<p>For the payment of personal and corporate income tax, the non-resident income tax and the legal entities tax, an additional period of 2 months will automatically be granted, in addition to the normal payment term, without interests for late payment being imposed.

</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Accelerated VAT refunds</span></em></li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>As of the VAT return of February 2020, all filers of monthly VAT returns can apply for a monthly VAT refund. Previously, this option was only available for license holders and start-up (during the first 24 months of activity). The accelerated VAT refunds do not apply for companies filing on a quarterly basis.
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.

<li><strong><span>Social security </span></strong>
<p><span>Measures for both companies and self-employed persons were announced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for companies:</span></em><br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>
</ul>

<p> </p>
</li>
<li><strong><span>(Un)employment measures and support for the economy</span></strong>
<ul>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary unemployment:</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Although there are two types of temporary unemployment in Belgium, i.e. for economic reasons and in case of force majeure, a broad application of the concept of 'force majeure' will be accepted from 13 March 2020 (and for the entire duration of the governmental measures) and all situations of temporary unemployment by the coronavirus will be regarded as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even though it may be possible to work for several days. There is currently no prior notification, but this may become the case in the coming weeks. In the meantime, this government measure has been extended to 19 April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may apply to:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>blue collar workers and white-collar workers (from the private, public and non-profit sectors);</span></li>
<li><span>temporary workers during the term of their temporary employment contract (possibly renewable);</span></li>
<li><span>staff working in educational institutions;</span></li>
<li><span>students who follow an alternating course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure does not apply to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>civil servants;</span></li>
<li><span>students;</span></li>
<li><span>full-time self-employed persons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, the following additional measures are taken to limit loss of income:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unemployment benefits are temporarily increased from 65% to 70% of the average capped salary (capped at EUR 2,754.76 per month);</span></li>
<li><span>Unemployment days are equated and included in the calculation of the holiday allowance; </span></li>
<li><span>The authorities (exceptionally) grant an extra amount of EUR 5.63 per day of unemployment on top of the unemployment benefit.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corona nuisance Subsidy (Flanders region):</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Businesses affected by a mandatory closure receive a one-off premium of € 4,000. If additional mandatory closing measures extend the closing period after April 5, 2020, the company will receive an additional closing premium from its location for each additional closing day. This is € 160 per mandatory closing day that coincides with a normal opening day. In the meantime, the government measures have been extended to April 19, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>The Corona nuisance Subsidy can be applied for online until 5 May 2020 at <a href=""http://www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be</span></a>. The required information is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>an e-id and e-id pin code or another digital key (itsme, ...).</span></li>
<li><span>An active Belgian account number of your company (IBAN format).</span></li>
<li><span>the regular opening days, as applicable before the Coronavirus measures.</span></li>
<li><span>The website address (url) of your company.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">• Flexibility in the execution of federal public procurement</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>For all public procurement government contracts for which can be proven that they are delayed or non-executed due to the Coronavirus crisis, the federal government will not impose fines or sanctions on service providers, companies or self-employed contractors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Loans and guarantees</span></strong></li>
<p> </p>
</ol><ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extension of the PMV guarantee scheme</span></em>
<p><span>The Flemish regional government decided to expand the existing ""generic"" guarantee scheme, with an additional Coronavirus crisis guarantee of 100 million euros. Via the Coronavirus guarantee scheme companies and self-employed persons can guarantee bridging loans for up to 12 months for existing non-bank debts, while this is only possible for up to 3 months for the existing guarantee scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the cost of the guarantee for the entrepreneur is reduced with 50%, to 0.25%.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, under the Coronavirus crisis guarantee, bank debts (in addition to supplier debts) of existing credit lines and investment credits that have not yet been placed under guarantee can be guaranteed insofar as the bank is also prepared to allow a minimum of 3 months payment delay or maintain credit lines. As such, the crisis guarantee serves as a catalyst for a flexible banking policy towards companies.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The federal government and financial sector reach an agreement to facilitate lending to private individuals, the self-employed and companies </span></em>
<p><span>In order to continue to ensure financing to private individuals, the self-employed and companies during this difficult period, the federal government has drawn up an agreement with the financial sector. This agreement consists of two pillars:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The financial sector is committed to defer payment to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed, as well as mortgage borrowers at risk of payment difficulties due to the corona crisis, until 30 September 2020;</span></li>
<li><span>The federal government will activate a guarantee scheme for all new credits and credit lines with a maximum term of 12 months, which will be provided by banks to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed. The purpose of this guarantee scheme is to maintain the financing of the Belgian economy.<br>
<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Insurance sector </span></em></li>
<p><span>For companies, a number of insurance policies (accidents at work, civil liability, etc.) already offer the option of adjusting the premium afterwards if there is a reduction in activity. This will be adjusted automatically. In addition, companies that are required to shut down their activities can obtain deferral of payment of their premium for all premiums that expire between March 30 and September 30 in consultation with their insurer. Finally, the same extension of payment will be applied on loans granted to companies as granted by the banking sector (until 30 September 2020). </span></p>

<p><span>Moreover, the cost of the guarantee for the entrepreneur is reduced with 50%, to 0.25%.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, under the Coronavirus crisis guarantee, bank debts (in addition to supplier debts) of existing credit lines and investment credits that have not yet been placed under guarantee can be guaranteed insofar as the bank is also prepared to allow a minimum of 3 months payment delay or maintain credit lines.

Overview of support measures in Belgium in the context of the corona crisis (Covid-19) - Update 30/03/2020,31/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>It is clear that the Coronavirus disrupts our society and economy.

<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of payment of taxes:</span></em>
<p>In addition to the automatic payment deferrals described below, any taxpayer affected by the Covid-19 crisis may request additional payment periods (payment plan), exemption from interest for late payment and / or cancellation of late payment penalties. This payment facility exists for VAT, corporate tax, non-resident tax, personal income tax and withholding tax and must be applied for no later than June 30, 2020.</p>

This measure applies to the settlement of taxes for tax year 2019, established from 12 March 2020</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of property tax for companies</span></em></li>
<p>With regard to property tax for companies, it was decided to issue the property tax assessments for companies at a later date in order to alleviate companies financially. The assessment notes will only be sent towards the end of 2020.</p>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Accelerated VAT refunds</span></em></li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>As of the VAT return of February 2020, all filers of monthly VAT returns can apply for a monthly VAT refund. Previously, this option was only available for license holders and start-up (during the first 24 months of activity). The accelerated VAT refunds do not apply for companies filing on a quarterly basis.
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Social security </span></strong>
<p><span>Measures for both companies and self-employed persons were announced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for companies:</span></em><br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>
</ul>

Mobility allowance versus mobility budget: what’s in a name?,01/04/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>In the context of striving for sustainable mobility, a number of measures have been introduced by the government that should be an attractive alternative to the company car.</span></p>
<p><span>The first concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility allowance</span> that was introduced as per January 1, 2018. This allowance offers employees the opportunity to trade in their company car for a monthly cash allowance = cash for car.</span></p>
<p><span>The second concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility budget</span> that is applicable as from March 1, 2019. The mobility budget means that an employee can trade in his company car up to a certain amount for a more environmentally friendly and cheaper car. The rest of the budget can then be spent on sustainable means of transport such as a subscription to public transport, a car sharing system, a bicycle allowance, etc. Any balance will be paid out in cash at the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that both measures apply, it is time for a comparative overview.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Comparison of both measures</em></strong></p>
<p><span>The award conditions are identical, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The employer must have made a company car available to at least one employee for at least 36 months.  Start-up companies that have not been in operation for 36 months can still offer the systems if they already have company cars in their pay packages for 12 months.</span></li>
<li><span>The employee must have been entitled to a company car for at least 12 months in the 36 months prior to the application, of which at least 3 months must be uninterrupted before the application.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>However, they do not apply when an employee is recruited or promoted or in case of a function change before 1 March 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, neither of these measures are mandatory: the employer is not required to offer them and the employee is not required to accept them!</span></p>
<p><span>The main differences are in the following areas:</span></p>

Overview of support measures in Belgium in the context of the corona crisis (Covid-19) - Update 30/03/2020,31/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>It is clear that the Coronavirus disrupts our society and economy. In order to limit the impact on businesses and self-employed persons, the Belgian government has issued an array of support measures. Below, we provide you with an overview of the different measures in the field of taxation, social security, (un)employment and the economy, as well as financing and guarantee schemes.</span></p>

<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of payment of taxes:</span></em>
<p>In addition to the automatic payment deferrals described below, any taxpayer affected by the Covid-19 crisis may request additional payment periods (payment plan), exemption from interest for late payment and / or cancellation of late payment penalties. This payment facility exists for VAT, corporate tax, non-resident tax, personal income tax and withholding tax and must be applied for no later than June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>Automatic deferral of payment:</p>

<p>For the payment of personal and corporate income tax, the non-resident income tax and the legal entities tax, an additional period of 2 months will automatically be granted, in addition to the normal payment term, without interests for late payment being imposed. This measure applies to the settlement of taxes for tax year 2019, established from 12 March 2020</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of property tax for companies</span></em></li>
<p>With regard to property tax for companies, it was decided to issue the property tax assessments for companies at a later date in order to alleviate companies financially. The assessment notes will only be sent towards the end of 2020.</p>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Accelerated VAT refunds</span></em></li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>As of the VAT return of February 2020, all filers of monthly VAT returns can apply for a monthly VAT refund. Previously, this option was only available for license holders and start-up (during the first 24 months of activity). The accelerated VAT refunds do not apply for companies filing on a quarterly basis.
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Social security </span></strong>
<p><span>Measures for both companies and self-employed persons were announced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for companies:</span></em><br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li><strong><span>(Un)employment measures and support for the economy</span></strong>
<ul>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary unemployment:</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Although there are two types of temporary unemployment in Belgium, i.e. for economic reasons and in case of force majeure, a broad application of the concept of 'force majeure' will be accepted from 13 March 2020 (and for the entire duration of the governmental measures) and all situations of temporary unemployment by the coronavirus will be regarded as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even though it may be possible to work for several days. There is currently no prior notification, but this may become the case in the coming weeks. In the meantime, this government measure has been extended to 19 April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may apply to:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>blue collar workers and white-collar workers (from the private, public and non-profit sectors);</span></li>
<li><span>temporary workers during the term of their temporary employment contract (possibly renewable);</span></li>
<li><span>staff working in educational institutions;</span></li>
<li><span>students who follow an alternating course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure does not apply to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>civil servants;</span></li>
<li><span>students;</span></li>
<li><span>full-time self-employed persons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, the following additional measures are taken to limit loss of income:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unemployment benefits are temporarily increased from 65% to 70% of the average capped salary (capped at EUR 2,754.76 per month);</span></li>
<li><span>Unemployment days are equated and included in the calculation of the holiday allowance; </span></li>
<li><span>The authorities (exceptionally) grant an extra amount of EUR 5.63 per day of unemployment on top of the unemployment benefit.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corona nuisance Subsidy (Flanders region):</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Businesses affected by a mandatory closure receive a one-off premium of € 4,000. If additional mandatory closing measures extend the closing period after April 5, 2020, the company will receive an additional closing premium from its location for each additional closing day. This is € 160 per mandatory closing day that coincides with a normal opening day. In the meantime, the government measures have been extended to April 19, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>The Corona nuisance Subsidy can be applied for online until 5 May 2020 at <a href=""http://www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be</span></a>. The required information is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>an e-id and e-id pin code or another digital key (itsme, ...).</span></li>
<li><span>An active Belgian account number of your company (IBAN format).</span></li>
<li><span>the regular opening days, as applicable before the Coronavirus measures.</span></li>
<li><span>The website address (url) of your company.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">• Flexibility in the execution of federal public procurement</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>For all public procurement government contracts for which can be proven that they are delayed or non-executed due to the Coronavirus crisis, the federal government will not impose fines or sanctions on service providers, companies or self-employed contractors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Loans and guarantees</span></strong></li>
<p> </p>
</ol><ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extension of the PMV guarantee scheme</span></em>
<p><span>The Flemish regional government decided to expand the existing ""generic"" guarantee scheme, with an additional Coronavirus crisis guarantee of 100 million euros. Via the Coronavirus guarantee scheme companies and self-employed persons can guarantee bridging loans for up to 12 months for existing non-bank debts, while this is only possible for up to 3 months for the existing guarantee scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the cost of the guarantee for the entrepreneur is reduced with 50%, to 0.25%.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, under the Coronavirus crisis guarantee, bank debts (in addition to supplier debts) of existing credit lines and investment credits that have not yet been placed under guarantee can be guaranteed insofar as the bank is also prepared to allow a minimum of 3 months payment delay or maintain credit lines. As such, the crisis guarantee serves as a catalyst for a flexible banking policy towards companies.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The federal government and financial sector reach an agreement to facilitate lending to private individuals, the self-employed and companies </span></em>
<p><span>In order to continue to ensure financing to private individuals, the self-employed and companies during this difficult period, the federal government has drawn up an agreement with the financial sector. This agreement consists of two pillars:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The financial sector is committed to defer payment to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed, as well as mortgage borrowers at risk of payment difficulties due to the corona crisis, until 30 September 2020;</span></li>
<li><span>The federal government will activate a guarantee scheme for all new credits and credit lines with a maximum term of 12 months, which will be provided by banks to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed. The purpose of this guarantee scheme is to maintain the financing of the Belgian economy.<br>
<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Insurance sector </span></em></li>
<p><span>For companies, a number of insurance policies (accidents at work, civil liability, etc.) already offer the option of adjusting the premium afterwards if there is a reduction in activity. This will be adjusted automatically. In addition, companies that are required to shut down their activities can obtain deferral of payment of their premium for all premiums that expire between March 30 and September 30 in consultation with their insurer. Finally, the same extension of payment will be applied on loans granted to companies as granted by the banking sector (until 30 September 2020). </span></p>

<p><span>For any further measures regarding suspension of contracts, both private individuals and companies are advised to contact their insurer or broker directly. </span></p>
</ul>

<p><span>Several additional support measures are still under negotiation/debate. We will of course keep you informed of any updates in this regard.</span></p>

Adjustments to the VVPR-bis regulation,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Law of January 21, 2022 regarding tax provisions (Belgian Official Gazette, January 28, 2022) has made a number of changes to the existing VVPR-bis regime.  This regime means that if certain conditions are met, dividends distributed by SME companies can benefit from a reduced withholding tax of 20% if they are distributed from the profit of the second financial year after that of the contribution and 15% if they are distributed from the profit of the third financial year. The amended regulation applies to <strong>dividends that are attributed or made payable as of 1 January 2022.</strong>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><br>
Pay-up obligation </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the conditions for the VVPR-bis regime is that the dividends must originate from new shares issued as from 1 July 2013 as compensation for a capital contribution <strong>paid up in cash</strong>. This pay-up must have been done at the time of the dividend payment.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following the entry into force of the new Company Code on May 1, 2019, the concept of 'capital' was abolished for a number of company forms. This has led to many private limited companies reducing their 'capital' to EUR 1 by, for example, an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The question then arose as to whether the capital of EUR 1 could continue to be classified as VVPR-bis capital and whether all dividends, including those from reserves prior to the capital reduction, could continue to benefit from the reduced withholding tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A ruling dated April 21, 2020 confirmed that the capital must be paid up at the time the dividend is attributed of paid “whereby the benefit of the reduced withholding tax cannot be denied due to the fact that the capital was not fully paid up at the time of conversion to a private limited company”. This meant that all future dividends could be paid out at the reduced rate and that the original contribution of EUR 18.550 did not have to be fully paid up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, this was beyond the reckoning of the government, which was of the opinion that the initially subscribed contribution must be fully paid up in order to be able to benefit from the VVPR-bis regime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The problem with this is that a company that has reduced its capital in the past, can never pay up its initial capital as it now only has EUR 1 capital.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That is why a <strong>temporary transitional regulation </strong>has now been introduced, which provides that companies that have reduced their contribution in good faith by means of an exemption from the pay up obligation between 1 May 2019 and 15 December 2021 , can still benefit from the VVPR-bis benefits, provided that they bring back their contribution to the initially subscribed amount by means of a cash contribution and this before 31 December 2022. This means that these companies will first have to carry out a new capital increase before being able to pay out dividends with application of the VVPR-bis benefits. Note that a later capital reduction does not constitute an obstacle to the VVPR-bis regime. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Waiting period </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The reduced withholding tax only applies after the expiry of a so-called waiting period.  Following the above, it has been determined that the waiting period to do a dividend payment is applicable on an ongoing basis<strong> as of the date of the initial contribution</strong> and not as of the date of the capital increase as previously envisaged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Non-preferential shares </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Another condition of the VVPR-bis regime is that the shares issued as a result of the contribution may not be preferential. In this regard, it is now stipulated that the shares may <strong>only be non-preferential with regard to the participation in the profits or the capital or the distribution of the equity</strong>.  Shares with multiple voting rights, on the other hand, are considered not to be preferential for the application of the VVPR-bis scheme.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In addition to the existing exclusions (for amounts contributed that originate from reserves 'locked up' in the past and amounts originating from a capital decrease in an affiliated or associated company), a new exclusion applies to amounts contributed that arise from a distribution of a liquidation reserve by an affiliated or associated company on which a reduced withholding tax of 5% was levied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
After a period of legal uncertainty in connection with a number of conditions for the application of the VVPR-bis regime, the Law of January 21, 2022 did introduce a number of clarifications.  Keeping the waiting period from the moment of the initial contribution is certainly one of them.  And also VVPR-bis companies that proceeded to an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full also know what to do before the end of the year.</p>

Overview of support measures in Belgium in the context of the corona crisis (Covid-19) - Update 30/03/2020,31/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>It is clear that the Coronavirus disrupts our society and economy. In order to limit the impact on businesses and self-employed persons, the Belgian government has issued an array of support measures. Below, we provide you with an overview of the different measures in the field of taxation, social security, (un)employment and the economy, as well as financing and guarantee schemes.</span></p>
<ol>

<br>
<ul>

<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferment of payment of taxes:</span></em>
<p>In addition to the automatic payment deferrals described below, any taxpayer affected by the Covid-19 crisis may request additional payment periods (payment plan), exemption from interest for late payment and / or cancellation of late payment penalties. This payment facility exists for VAT, corporate tax, non-resident tax, personal income tax and withholding tax and must be applied for no later than June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>Automatic deferral of payment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">VAT</span>
<p>An <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">automatic </span> extension of payment of two months for VAT without having to pay fines or interest. This deferral applies to the payment for the period:</p>

<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corporate tax, legal entities tax, personal income tax and non-resident income tax </span>
<p>For the payment of personal and corporate income tax, the non-resident income tax and the legal entities tax, an additional period of 2 months will automatically be granted, in addition to the normal payment term, without interests for late payment being imposed. This measure applies to the settlement of taxes for tax year 2019, established from 12 March 2020</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of property tax for companies</span></em></li>
<p>With regard to property tax for companies, it was decided to issue the property tax assessments for companies at a later date in order to alleviate companies financially. The assessment notes will only be sent towards the end of 2020.</p>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Accelerated VAT refunds</span></em></li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>As of the VAT return of February 2020, all filers of monthly VAT returns can apply for a monthly VAT refund. Previously, this option was only available for license holders and start-up (during the first 24 months of activity). The accelerated VAT refunds do not apply for companies filing on a quarterly basis.
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Social security </span></strong>
<p><span>Measures for both companies and self-employed persons were announced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for companies:</span></em><br>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li><strong><span>(Un)employment measures and support for the economy</span></strong>
<ul>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary unemployment:</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Although there are two types of temporary unemployment in Belgium, i.e. for economic reasons and in case of force majeure, a broad application of the concept of 'force majeure' will be accepted from 13 March 2020 (and for the entire duration of the governmental measures) and all situations of temporary unemployment by the coronavirus will be regarded as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even though it may be possible to work for several days. There is currently no prior notification, but this may become the case in the coming weeks. In the meantime, this government measure has been extended to 19 April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may apply to:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>blue collar workers and white-collar workers (from the private, public and non-profit sectors);</span></li>
<li><span>temporary workers during the term of their temporary employment contract (possibly renewable);</span></li>
<li><span>staff working in educational institutions;</span></li>
<li><span>students who follow an alternating course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure does not apply to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>civil servants;</span></li>
<li><span>students;</span></li>
<li><span>full-time self-employed persons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, the following additional measures are taken to limit loss of income:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unemployment benefits are temporarily increased from 65% to 70% of the average capped salary (capped at EUR 2,754.76 per month);</span></li>
<li><span>Unemployment days are equated and included in the calculation of the holiday allowance; </span></li>
<li><span>The authorities (exceptionally) grant an extra amount of EUR 5.63 per day of unemployment on top of the unemployment benefit.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corona nuisance Subsidy (Flanders region):</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Businesses affected by a mandatory closure receive a one-off premium of € 4,000. If additional mandatory closing measures extend the closing period after April 5, 2020, the company will receive an additional closing premium from its location for each additional closing day. This is € 160 per mandatory closing day that coincides with a normal opening day. In the meantime, the government measures have been extended to April 19, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>The Corona nuisance Subsidy can be applied for online until 5 May 2020 at <a href=""http://www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be</span></a>. The required information is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>an e-id and e-id pin code or another digital key (itsme, ...).</span></li>
<li><span>An active Belgian account number of your company (IBAN format).</span></li>
<li><span>the regular opening days, as applicable before the Coronavirus measures.</span></li>
<li><span>The website address (url) of your company.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">• Flexibility in the execution of federal public procurement</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>For all public procurement government contracts for which can be proven that they are delayed or non-executed due to the Coronavirus crisis, the federal government will not impose fines or sanctions on service providers, companies or self-employed contractors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Loans and guarantees</span></strong></li>
<p> </p>
</ol><ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extension of the PMV guarantee scheme</span></em>
<p><span>The Flemish regional government decided to expand the existing ""generic"" guarantee scheme, with an additional Coronavirus crisis guarantee of 100 million euros. Via the Coronavirus guarantee scheme companies and self-employed persons can guarantee bridging loans for up to 12 months for existing non-bank debts, while this is only possible for up to 3 months for the existing guarantee scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the cost of the guarantee for the entrepreneur is reduced with 50%, to 0.25%.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, under the Coronavirus crisis guarantee, bank debts (in addition to supplier debts) of existing credit lines and investment credits that have not yet been placed under guarantee can be guaranteed insofar as the bank is also prepared to allow a minimum of 3 months payment delay or maintain credit lines. As such, the crisis guarantee serves as a catalyst for a flexible banking policy towards companies.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The federal government and financial sector reach an agreement to facilitate lending to private individuals, the self-employed and companies </span></em>
<p><span>In order to continue to ensure financing to private individuals, the self-employed and companies during this difficult period, the federal government has drawn up an agreement with the financial sector. This agreement consists of two pillars:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The financial sector is committed to defer payment to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed, as well as mortgage borrowers at risk of payment difficulties due to the corona crisis, until 30 September 2020;</span></li>
<li><span>The federal government will activate a guarantee scheme for all new credits and credit lines with a maximum term of 12 months, which will be provided by banks to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed. The purpose of this guarantee scheme is to maintain the financing of the Belgian economy.<br>
<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Insurance sector </span></em></li>
<p><span>For companies, a number of insurance policies (accidents at work, civil liability, etc.) already offer the option of adjusting the premium afterwards if there is a reduction in activity. This will be adjusted automatically. In addition, companies that are required to shut down their activities can obtain deferral of payment of their premium for all premiums that expire between March 30 and September 30 in consultation with their insurer. Finally, the same extension of payment will be applied on loans granted to companies as granted by the banking sector (until 30 September 2020). </span></p>

<p><span>For any further measures regarding suspension of contracts, both private individuals and companies are advised to contact their insurer or broker directly. </span></p>
</ul>

<p><span>Several additional support measures are still under negotiation/debate. We will of course keep you informed of any updates in this regard.</span></p>

When it is mandatory to appoint a statutory auditor?,13/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span>Everyone knows the criteria for determining whether or not a company is 'large' and therefore, in principle, must appoint a statutory auditor.  But what if a company is part of a group that must or must not consolidate? And what if the company is part of an international group?<br>
What follows is a short summary.<br>
</span></p>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Stand-alone companies   </span></h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>A company is considered to be large and must therefore appoint a statutory auditor if more than one of the following three criteria is exceeded:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual average workforce: 50 employees</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual turnover excluding VAT: 9,000,000 euros</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Balance sheet total: 4,500,000 euros</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>If more than one of these three criteria is exceeded or no longer exceeded, this only has consequences if this occurs in two consecutive financial years. The consequences will then take effect from the following financial year. </span>Suppose: a company exceeds more than one of the three criteria for the financial years 2019  and 2020, then it will be considered large as from the financial year 2021 and must appoint a statutory auditor.</p>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Companies that are part of a Belgian group that is required to consolidate</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When a company is part of a group of companies that are obliged to consolidate, a statutory auditor must be appointed even if the company concerned is considered small in itself. </span>In Belgium, the consolidation obligation exists for any company that alone or jointly controls one or more subsidiaries or forms a consortium, except:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company itself is a subsidiary.</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company is a parent company that only has subsidiaries of negligible significance.</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company is part of a group of ‘limited’ size.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>A group of ‘’limited’ size is then a group that on a consolidated basis does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual average workforce: 250 employees</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual turnover excluding VAT: 34,000,000 euros</span></li>

Important upcoming changes to the EU VAT rules for e-commerce,30/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>As of the first of July 2021, the ‘VAT e-commerce package’ will introduce significant changes to the current VAT legislation for cross-border e-commerce trade in the EU. These new VAT rules are introduced with the goal to facilitate cross-border trade, combat VAT fraud and ensure fair competition for EU businesses. You can find th most notable changes to the EU VAT rules in this article.</p>
<h2>Abolishment of the distance sales thresholds</h2>
<p>
Until the 30th of June, every EU Member State has set a so-called ‘distance sale threshold’, ranging from 35.000 to 100.000 Euro (excl. VAT), or the equivalent in local currency. Once e-commerce traders exceed the distance sales threshold for a given Member State, their B2C distance sales of goods become VAT taxable in the Member State of arrival of the goods (instead of the Member State of departure) under the current rules, entailing local VAT registration and periodical compliance obligations in said Member State(s).<br>
<br>
As of the 1st of July 2021, these distance sales thresholds will be abolished (only a threshold of 10.000 Euro (excl. VAT) for micro-enterprises, with a very limited scope, will remain). Hence, the B2C intra-Community distance sales of goods will be principally VAT taxable in the Member State of arrival of the goods. In order to limit the VAT registration and compliance burden in the hands of e-commerce traders, it was decided to extend the Mini One Stop Shop, to all B2C services and to intra-Community distance sales of goods, making it a One Stop Shop (‘OSS’). As a result, it will be possible to report and pay VAT due on B2C services and intra-Community distance sales of goods in other Member States via a single OSS return in the Member State of identification. Businesses should investigate whether they can close their historic VAT registrations in other EU Member States due to the impact of these new rules.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Cancellation of the VAT exemption for low value imports</h2>
<p>
As of the 1st of July 2021, the VAT exemption for the import of consignments of a low value of up to EUR 22 will be abolished. As a result, VAT will principally become due on all importations of commercial goods into the EU. In order to facilitate trade, an import scheme (I-OSS) has been created covering distance sales of goods imported from third territories or third countries to customers in the EU up to a value of EUR 150.
<br>
As of the 1st of July 2021, when the import scheme (I-OSS) is used, the seller will charge and collect the VAT at the point of sale to EU customers and report and pay that VAT to the Member State of identification in the I-OSS (similar to the OSS return). These goods will then benefit from a VAT exemption upon importation, allowing for faster customs clearance.</p>
<h2>E-commerce platforms may be considered to be deemed suppliers</h2>
<p>
Businesses operating electronic interfaces such as online marketplaces or platforms will, in certain situations, be considered to be a intermediary supplier of the goods sold to customers in the EU (legal fiction). As a result, the marketplace or platform will in these situations be required to collect and pay the VAT on these sales.</p>

Tax-friendly remuneration: the corona premium,05/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>In the context of the wage agreement in which a maximum wage increase of 0.4% above the obligatory indexation was agreed, it was further decided that this may still be supplemented with a 'corona premium'.</p>
<h2>The corona premium for employees</h2>
<p>The corona premium can be granted by employers to their employees from 1 August 2021 to 31 December 2021. This will be paid in the form of cheques. The cheques will be valid until December 31, 2022. </p>
<p>The granting must be contained in a collective labour agreement concluded at sectoral or company level.  In the absence of a trade union delegation, the granting may also be done in a written individual agreement. The maximum amount that can be granted is EUR 500,00.  It can be spent in the catering, sports and cultural sector as well as in retail stores that have been closed for at least a month.</p>
<p>For social security purposes, the corona premium is not regarded as salary, so that no ordinary social security contributions are due (neither employer nor employee contributions). There is only a special employer's contribution of 16.5%.</p>
<p>For tax purposes, the premium as well as the special employer's contribution can be deducted as professional expense for employers. For employees, it is an exempt social benefit. Therefore, no tax is due. </p>
<h2>The corona premium for self-employed persons </h2>
<p>Self-employed persons can also qualify for a premium if they have received a ‘bridging right’ for 6 months in the period from 1 October 2020 to 30 April 2021. The gross amount is EUR 598,80 and is paid in cash. It can be spent wherever the individual wants. The premium is taxable separately at 16.5%, so that it amounts to EUR 500,00 net. Both companies’ directors as other self-employed persons as well as coworking spouses can benefit from the premium.  Self-employed persons in a secondary occupation are also eligible, provided that the social contributions they pay are as high as those of a self-employed person in main occupation. The premium was automatically paid by the social security funds on 30 September 2021 at the latest, but does not accrue social rights.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The corona premium gives employers an additional opportunity to provide their employees with an extra remuneration in a tax-friendly manner. </p>

Change procedure optional VAT liability,24/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In Belgium, any person who, other than in the exercise of his <strong>VAT taxable economic activity</strong>, has erected or acquired a <strong>""new"" building</strong> or <strong>part of a ""new"" building</strong> with application of VAT, has the right to opt for the status of coincidental VAT taxpayer when the latter wishes to sell this immovable property or to establish or (re)transfer a right in rem on it with application of VAT. One of the conditions is that the property is still considered ""new"" within the meaning of the VAT code, i.e. the transfer of the property or of the right in rem <strong>takes place no later than 31 December</strong> of the second year following the year of the first occupation or first use of the building or part of building in question.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The advantage of this <strong>optional VAT liability</strong> is that the VAT on the establishment or purchase of the real estate <strong>can be recovered</strong> in this way. The Belgian VAT administration requires certain notification and declaration formalities to be complied with in order for the optional VAT tax liability to be exercised, namely: </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>Prior to the sale</strong>, the seller is obliged to submit to the VAT authorities an advance declaration on paper (declaration no. 104.1);</span></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span><strong>An express statement</strong> of the intention to dispose of the property with VAT or to create or (re)transfer the immovable right in rem with the application of VAT must be included in the first deed concluded between the parties. When disposing of a property, this is usually the contract of sale (although it is accepted that this intention is concretised in a promise of sale). Upon submission of Declaration No 104.1, the transferor or transferee receives a file number from the VAT administration, which the notary includes in the deed of transfer or establishment. This file number provides assurance to the notary and the co-contractor that the sale is taking place under the VAT regime.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>After the sale</strong>, the seller must submit a special declaration (declaration no. 104.5) to the VAT administration. This declaration no. 104.5 shall be submitted within the month after the VAT has become due and must state the amount received from the buyer (taxable amount and VAT), the VAT deducted and the difference between the VAT due and deductible on the part of the seller (or transferor). The VAT balance will have to be paid or refunded, as the case may be.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In response to the administrative burden these formalities imposed on the VAT administration, it was decided to <strong>simplify and modernise</strong> the aforementioned procedure.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The <strong>obligation to submit</strong> prior declaration no. 104.1 will be abolished without further ado. The follow-up of real estate transactions with application of VAT will henceforth be done <strong>on the basis of the first deed between the parties</strong> showing the transferor's intention to apply VAT to the sale or on the basis of the notarial deed between the parties. Thus, the aforementioned step 1 in the administrative procedure will be abolished. However, step 2 (entry of intention to apply VAT) and step 3 (filing of special declaration (declaration no. 104.5)) remain valid</span></p>

Partial professional withholding tax exemption for R&D: a correct notification is important,23/06/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">Partial professional withholding tax exemption for R&amp;D: a correct notification is important</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Belgian tax law provides for various incentives in order to support companies with their research &amp; development activities / investments. One of these tax incentives – which is often applied - is the so-called partial professional withholding tax exemption for R&amp;D (hereinafter also referred to as the “R&amp;D WHT exemption”).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Various conditions and (notification) formalities have to be respected in order to be able to benefit from the R&amp;D WHT exemption. Non or incorrect / incomplete compliance with the (notification) formalities may, upon a tax audit, jeopardize the application of the regime. This has been confirmed by the Court of Hasselt recently again. </span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Please find hereinafter a high level and simplified overview of this regime.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">General principle</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Belgian tax law provides (subject to conditions) for a R&amp;D WHT exemption for (amongst others) universities, colleges, recognized scientific institutions, companies which pay remunerations to researchers working on R&amp;D projects in accordance with a cooperation agreement with the aforementioned institutions, as well as for companies that qualify as a so-called “Young Innovative Company” and which pay remunerations to certain scientific personnel employed by this company.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">A Young Innovative Company is a company which executes research projects and, at the end of the taxable period,</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: black;"">qualifies as a small company (as specifically determined for this incentive);</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span>exists for less than 10 years before 1 January of the year in which the R&amp;D WHT exemptionis granted;</li>
<li>was not incorporated in the context of a concentration, restructuring, expansion of a previous activity or a takeover of such activities;</li>
<li>has incurred R&amp;D expenditures representing at least 15% of the total costs of the previous taxable period.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">If, at the end of the taxable period, the company no longer fulfills the conditions to qualify as a <em>Young Innovative Company</em>, the R&amp;D WHT exemption can no longer be applied to the salaries paid / awarded from the following month. </span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Next to the above-mentioned institutions / entities, the R&amp;D WHT exemption may (subject to conditions) also be claimed by companies which pay or grant remunerations to employees (“researchers”) employed by such companies in R&amp;D projects or programs (i.e. projects or programs aimed at fundamental or industrial research or experimental development – these concepts are further defined in Belgian tax law) provided that the employees have one of the required diplomas.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">Amount of the R&amp;D WHT exemption</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">The R&amp;D WHT exemption is capped at max 80% of the professional withholding tax due on the salary of the qualifying researcher and has to be determined in function of the actual time spent on R&amp;D (i.e. <em>pro rata temporis</em>). Underling documentation has to be prepared / available in order to support this (e.g. via time sheets).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Since 2020, the R&amp;D WHT exemption of max 80% is also applicable to qualifying bachelors (which was capped at 40% before). The total amount of R&amp;D WHT exemption for qualifying bachelors may, however, not exceed 25% of the total amount of the exemption claimed for employees with a specific master or PhD. Said 25% threshold is doubled to 50% for small companies.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">BELSPO notification</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">The above-mentioned projects or programs have – prior to the application of the R&amp;D WHT exemption – to be notified to BELSPO. A specific registration tool has been made available in this respect. Important to note is that Belgian tax law stipulates that – amongst others - the following elements have to be reported:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: black;"">the identification of the debtor of the professional withholding tax;</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span>a description of the project or program indicating the fundamental or industrial research or experimental development nature/aim;</li>
<li>the expected start and anticipated end date of the project or program.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">BELSPO’s binding opinion regarding the qualification of the notified projects or programs can be requested in order to avoid future discussions.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">Expected start and end date</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">As indicated above, BELSPO has to be notified prior to the application of the R&amp;D WHT exemption whereby (amongst others) the expected start and anticipated end date of the project or program has to be mentioned. In practice, it is, however, often difficult to estimate the anticipated end date. Consequently, some companies do not report an anticipated end date in their notification. However, not mentioning an anticipated end date may, upon a tax audit, jeopardize the application of the R&amp;D WHT exemption (and, hence, the tax authorities may claim that the professional WHT due still has to be paid).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Useful reference can be made to a Parliamentary Question of 2020 to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance whereby the Minister referred in his reply to the legal requirements with regard to the aforementioned notification (including the fact that tax law provides that the expected start date and the anticipated end date of the project or program has to be reported in order to be able to claim the R&amp;D WHT exemption). </span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Although the Minister acknowledges that the expected / anticipated start and end date of the project or program may differ from the actual start and end date, the Minister stipulates that the expected / anticipated (reported) start and end date must be realistic. A notification that does not include an end date or that does not include a realistic, but a purely hypothetical end date does not meet the legal conditions regarding the notification requirement (and, hence, there is no legitimate basis to claim the R&amp;D WHT exemption).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">The fact that reporting an expected / anticipated start and end date is an essential condition for the possible application of the R&amp;D WHT exemption was recently confirmed by the Court of Hasselt as well.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">If you are currently applying the R&amp;D WHT exemption, it is highly advisable to verify (amongst others) the correct application of the notification requirement. Upon request we can explain this in more detail.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">If you are not (yet) applying the R&amp;D WHT exemption and you are performing research and development activities, do not hesitate to contact us so we can discuss the potential application of this regime (and/or any other potential tax incentive) in more detail.</span></p>

Adjustments to the VVPR-bis regulation,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Law of January 21, 2022 regarding tax provisions (Belgian Official Gazette, January 28, 2022) has made a number of changes to the existing VVPR-bis regime.  This regime means that if certain conditions are met, dividends distributed by SME companies can benefit from a reduced withholding tax of 20% if they are distributed from the profit of the second financial year after that of the contribution and 15% if they are distributed from the profit of the third financial year. The amended regulation applies to <strong>dividends that are attributed or made payable as of 1 January 2022.</strong>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><br>
Pay-up obligation </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the conditions for the VVPR-bis regime is that the dividends must originate from new shares issued as from 1 July 2013 as compensation for a capital contribution <strong>paid up in cash</strong>. This pay-up must have been done at the time of the dividend payment.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following the entry into force of the new Company Code on May 1, 2019, the concept of 'capital' was abolished for a number of company forms. This has led to many private limited companies reducing their 'capital' to EUR 1 by, for example, an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The question then arose as to whether the capital of EUR 1 could continue to be classified as VVPR-bis capital and whether all dividends, including those from reserves prior to the capital reduction, could continue to benefit from the reduced withholding tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A ruling dated April 21, 2020 confirmed that the capital must be paid up at the time the dividend is attributed of paid “whereby the benefit of the reduced withholding tax cannot be denied due to the fact that the capital was not fully paid up at the time of conversion to a private limited company”. This meant that all future dividends could be paid out at the reduced rate and that the original contribution of EUR 18.550 did not have to be fully paid up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, this was beyond the reckoning of the government, which was of the opinion that the initially subscribed contribution must be fully paid up in order to be able to benefit from the VVPR-bis regime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The problem with this is that a company that has reduced its capital in the past, can never pay up its initial capital as it now only has EUR 1 capital.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That is why a <strong>temporary transitional regulation </strong>has now been introduced, which provides that companies that have reduced their contribution in good faith by means of an exemption from the pay up obligation between 1 May 2019 and 15 December 2021 , can still benefit from the VVPR-bis benefits, provided that they bring back their contribution to the initially subscribed amount by means of a cash contribution and this before 31 December 2022. This means that these companies will first have to carry out a new capital increase before being able to pay out dividends with application of the VVPR-bis benefits. Note that a later capital reduction does not constitute an obstacle to the VVPR-bis regime. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Waiting period </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The reduced withholding tax only applies after the expiry of a so-called waiting period.  Following the above, it has been determined that the waiting period to do a dividend payment is applicable on an ongoing basis<strong> as of the date of the initial contribution</strong> and not as of the date of the capital increase as previously envisaged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Non-preferential shares </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Another condition of the VVPR-bis regime is that the shares issued as a result of the contribution may not be preferential. In this regard, it is now stipulated that the shares may <strong>only be non-preferential with regard to the participation in the profits or the capital or the distribution of the equity</strong>.  Shares with multiple voting rights, on the other hand, are considered not to be preferential for the application of the VVPR-bis scheme.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In addition to the existing exclusions (for amounts contributed that originate from reserves 'locked up' in the past and amounts originating from a capital decrease in an affiliated or associated company), a new exclusion applies to amounts contributed that arise from a distribution of a liquidation reserve by an affiliated or associated company on which a reduced withholding tax of 5% was levied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
After a period of legal uncertainty in connection with a number of conditions for the application of the VVPR-bis regime, the Law of January 21, 2022 did introduce a number of clarifications.  Keeping the waiting period from the moment of the initial contribution is certainly one of them.  And also VVPR-bis companies that proceeded to an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full also know what to do before the end of the year.</p>

VAT in the digital age (ViDA),17/07/2023,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<span style=""line-height: 120%;""><strong></strong></span>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The current<strong> EU VAT system for intra-EU trade</strong> is almost 30 years old and, despite some recent improvements, has not kept pace with technological advances, the digital economy, changes in business models, or globalisation. On 8 December 2022, the European Commission proposed a series of measures to modernize the EU's Value-Added Tax (VAT) system. The proposal is aimed to make VAT work better for businesses, more resilient to fraud by embracing and promoting digitalization.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The VAT in the Digital Age package takes full advantage of technological and digital advances to deliver on an updated VAT system. In a nutshell, the European Commission has put forward proposals for:</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>1. A move to real-time digital reporting based on e-invoicing for businesses that operate cross-border in the EU and a harmonised framework for domestic transactions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The new system introduces <strong>real-time, transaction-based digital reporting</strong> for VAT purposes, based on e-invoicing. Once operational, the system will give Member States valuable information they need to <strong>control cross-border transactions and step up the fight against cross-border VAT fraud</strong>, while reducing administrative and compliance costs for businesses. To make the best use of this data for VAT control and anti-fraud purposes, Member States will also be equipped with the appropriate administrative cooperation tools.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>2. Updated VAT rules for passenger transport and short-term accommodation platforms</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under the new rules, platform economy operators themselves will be deemed <strong>responsible for collecting VAT when service providers</strong> do not (because they are, for example, a small business not usually required to register for VAT) and for remitting this VAT to tax authorities. This, together with other clarifications, will ensure a uniform approach across all Member States and contribute to a more level playing field between online and traditional accommodation and transport services. It also makes life simpler for SMEs using the platforms as they will no longer need to understand and ensure compliance with VAT rules, often in other Member States.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>3. The introduction of a single VAT registration across the EU</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Building on the already existing ‘One Stop Shop' model for e-commerce traders, the EU Commission’s proposal will further reduce the circumstances in which businesses that want to sell to consumers in more than one Member State have to register in other Member States. With this reform, traders who operate cross-border can opt to register in only one Member State for their sales to consumers across the EU and for their transfers of goods for storage in other Member States. After registration in <strong>one Member State</strong>, they will then be able to fulfil their VAT obligations via a single online portal and interact solely with the tax administration of that Member State in one language, even though their sales are EU-wide. Smaller businesses, in particular those who want to scale-up, will benefit from the much simpler administration introduced by the new rules. The proposal also makes it mandatory for online platforms to register for the Import One Stop Shop which will further improve VAT compliance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Where are we now?</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The ViDA  proposals are likely to have a big impact for many businesses in the European Union. Currently, the ViDA is going through the consultation and legislative process at the EU level. In this regard, the EU Finance Ministers broadly agree with ViDA proposals. However, a call to delay the proposed timetable on e-invoicing and to further consider the rules on platform reforms was raised. Some EU Member States have also raised questions on the costs of the required IT investment. In July 2023, the EU Parliament called for 2-year delay on the measures.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>A final agreement and vote on the measures, their implementation and the timeline thereof is anticipate for the <strong>ECOFIN meeting of 17 October 2023</strong>. If the current timetable for implementation is kept and the first measure being implemented as of 1 January 2024, this will mean that businesses in the EU will have little time to adapt to the new rules. Although some delays and/or transitory measures are likely, businesses should prepare for the upcoming changes under ViDA.</span></p>

Important upcoming changes to the EU VAT rules for e-commerce,30/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>As of the first of July 2021, the ‘VAT e-commerce package’ will introduce significant changes to the current VAT legislation for cross-border e-commerce trade in the EU. These new VAT rules are introduced with the goal to facilitate cross-border trade, combat VAT fraud and ensure fair competition for EU businesses. You can find th most notable changes to the EU VAT rules in this article.</p>
<h2>Abolishment of the distance sales thresholds</h2>
<p>
Until the 30th of June, every EU Member State has set a so-called ‘distance sale threshold’, ranging from 35.000 to 100.000 Euro (excl. VAT), or the equivalent in local currency. Once e-commerce traders exceed the distance sales threshold for a given Member State, their B2C distance sales of goods become VAT taxable in the Member State of arrival of the goods (instead of the Member State of departure) under the current rules, entailing local VAT registration and periodical compliance obligations in said Member State(s).<br>
<br>
As of the 1st of July 2021, these distance sales thresholds will be abolished (only a threshold of 10.000 Euro (excl. VAT) for micro-enterprises, with a very limited scope, will remain). Hence, the B2C intra-Community distance sales of goods will be principally VAT taxable in the Member State of arrival of the goods. In order to limit the VAT registration and compliance burden in the hands of e-commerce traders, it was decided to extend the Mini One Stop Shop, to all B2C services and to intra-Community distance sales of goods, making it a One Stop Shop (‘OSS’). As a result, it will be possible to report and pay VAT due on B2C services and intra-Community distance sales of goods in other Member States via a single OSS return in the Member State of identification. Businesses should investigate whether they can close their historic VAT registrations in other EU Member States due to the impact of these new rules.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Cancellation of the VAT exemption for low value imports</h2>
<p>
As of the 1st of July 2021, the VAT exemption for the import of consignments of a low value of up to EUR 22 will be abolished. As a result, VAT will principally become due on all importations of commercial goods into the EU. In order to facilitate trade, an import scheme (I-OSS) has been created covering distance sales of goods imported from third territories or third countries to customers in the EU up to a value of EUR 150.
<br>
As of the 1st of July 2021, when the import scheme (I-OSS) is used, the seller will charge and collect the VAT at the point of sale to EU customers and report and pay that VAT to the Member State of identification in the I-OSS (similar to the OSS return). These goods will then benefit from a VAT exemption upon importation, allowing for faster customs clearance.</p>
<h2>E-commerce platforms may be considered to be deemed suppliers</h2>
<p>
Businesses operating electronic interfaces such as online marketplaces or platforms will, in certain situations, be considered to be a intermediary supplier of the goods sold to customers in the EU (legal fiction). As a result, the marketplace or platform will in these situations be required to collect and pay the VAT on these sales.</p>

Electronic invoicing,19/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Following the postponement of the introduction of mandatory <strong>electronic invoicing</strong> at the European level as part of the <strong>ViDA reforms</strong>, Belgium is implementing general mandatory electronic <strong>invoicing for B2B transactions from 1 January 2026</strong>. The move to mandatory electronic invoicing is important to reduce the VAT gap, the difference between what the government should receive in VAT revenue and what the government actually receives, and to further a reduction in the administrative burden for businesses.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What are the benefits of electronic invoicing?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span>E-invoicing is cheaper and faster.</span></li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">Faster invoicing results in faster payments and an improved cashflow for your company.</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">Incoming and outgoing invoices are recorded in the accounts immediately upon receipt or issuance of the invoices. This makes real-time accounting possible and the tool of choice to run your business.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 0cm;""> </p>
<p><span><strong>What impact will this change have?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span>Belgium has chosen to adopt the Peppol-Bis standard as its norm. An electronic PDF-format is no longer qualified as an electronic invoice ;</span></li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;""><span></span>Electronic invoicing becomes mandatory for almost all taxpayers based in Belgium;</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 0cm;"">The new rules apply to local B2B transactions in Belgium. The new rules do not apply to B2C transactions. Rules on electronic invoicing already exist for B2G.</li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Necessary actions for companies?</strong></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Although<strong> the finance minister</strong> speaks of an ample transition period during which businesses can get ready for <strong>mandatory B2B electronic invoicing</strong>, it is advisable to take the necessary steps to implement the new rules in business procedures and systems as soon as possible. Specifically, enterprises should ensure that their ERP package or invoicing tool can <strong>send, receive and process electronic invoices</strong> in the <strong>Peppol-standard</strong>. Finally, the electronic archive must ensure the readability, integrity and authenticity of the electronic data throughout th<strong>e mandatory 10-year retention period</strong>.</span></p>

Change procedure optional VAT liability,24/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In Belgium, any person who, other than in the exercise of his <strong>VAT taxable economic activity</strong>, has erected or acquired a <strong>""new"" building</strong> or <strong>part of a ""new"" building</strong> with application of VAT, has the right to opt for the status of coincidental VAT taxpayer when the latter wishes to sell this immovable property or to establish or (re)transfer a right in rem on it with application of VAT. One of the conditions is that the property is still considered ""new"" within the meaning of the VAT code, i.e. the transfer of the property or of the right in rem <strong>takes place no later than 31 December</strong> of the second year following the year of the first occupation or first use of the building or part of building in question.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The advantage of this <strong>optional VAT liability</strong> is that the VAT on the establishment or purchase of the real estate <strong>can be recovered</strong> in this way. The Belgian VAT administration requires certain notification and declaration formalities to be complied with in order for the optional VAT tax liability to be exercised, namely: </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>Prior to the sale</strong>, the seller is obliged to submit to the VAT authorities an advance declaration on paper (declaration no. 104.1);</span></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span><strong>An express statement</strong> of the intention to dispose of the property with VAT or to create or (re)transfer the immovable right in rem with the application of VAT must be included in the first deed concluded between the parties. When disposing of a property, this is usually the contract of sale (although it is accepted that this intention is concretised in a promise of sale). Upon submission of Declaration No 104.1, the transferor or transferee receives a file number from the VAT administration, which the notary includes in the deed of transfer or establishment. This file number provides assurance to the notary and the co-contractor that the sale is taking place under the VAT regime.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>After the sale</strong>, the seller must submit a special declaration (declaration no. 104.5) to the VAT administration. This declaration no. 104.5 shall be submitted within the month after the VAT has become due and must state the amount received from the buyer (taxable amount and VAT), the VAT deducted and the difference between the VAT due and deductible on the part of the seller (or transferor). The VAT balance will have to be paid or refunded, as the case may be.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In response to the administrative burden these formalities imposed on the VAT administration, it was decided to <strong>simplify and modernise</strong> the aforementioned procedure.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The <strong>obligation to submit</strong> prior declaration no. 104.1 will be abolished without further ado. The follow-up of real estate transactions with application of VAT will henceforth be done <strong>on the basis of the first deed between the parties</strong> showing the transferor's intention to apply VAT to the sale or on the basis of the notarial deed between the parties. Thus, the aforementioned step 1 in the administrative procedure will be abolished. However, step 2 (entry of intention to apply VAT) and step 3 (filing of special declaration (declaration no. 104.5)) remain valid</span></p>

The importance of advance payments for both partnerships and sole traders.,05/03/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<span style=""line-height: 120%;""></span>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background: white; color: black;"">Tax prepayments are important for both sole traders and corporations to maintain financial stability and avoid unnecessary tax increases. In 2024, this practice remains relevant for all taxpayers. Let's take a closer look at why prepayments are so essential and how taxpayers can take advantage of them.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>Tax increase for insufficient prepayments</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>For companies</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies that fail to pay enough in advance will face a tax increase. The multiplier rate for insufficient prepayments will rise <strong>in corporate tax from 6.75% (income year 2023) to 9% (income year 2024, assessment year 2025). </strong></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> </strong>There will be no increase for the first three financial years of a small company (Art. 1:24, §1 to 6 CCA).  However, prepayment in this particular case does allow you to account for future liabilities, which can be beneficial for your available cash. (see tip)</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>For sole traders</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Sole traders will also face tax increases if they fail to make sufficient prepayments on time.  The multiplier rate will increase <strong>in personal income tax from 4.5% (income year 2023) to 9% (income year 2024, assessment year 2025).</strong>  Which is a significant increase for these taxpayers.</li>
</ul>

</span></strong><em>Avoid tax increases</em></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">By making timely prepayments, taxpayers can avoid or reduce a tax increase. The increase is not tax-deductible and can be a significant financial burden.</li>

Will prepayments made then be lost or do you have to wait for the tax bill to recover these funds?  No, you can make a change of destination of your prepayments until 31 March of the following year (when the financial year equals the calendar year). You can carry forward (possibly partially) the prepayment to next financial year and/or claim an early refund. A combination of both, transfer and repay, is also possible.</p>

Tax deductibility of rental charges,19/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>From the assessment year 2024 onwards</span></strong><span>, a sole proprietorship or company can no longer deduct, for tax purposes, the rent paid for real estate used for professional purposes or the fee for the use of property rights (such as ground lease, surface rights, usufruct and easements) without completing additional formalities. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>From now on, you must attach a <strong>form 270 MLH per property,</strong> to your income tax return in order to deduct the rent or fee paid for tax purposes.  The form should communicate the following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>the location of the property</span></li>
<li><span> </span>the charge paid, and</li>
<li>the amount to be deducted for tax purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>If you pay an overall fee for several undeveloped plots, one form will suffice. Spouses or legal cohabitants who are taxed together and who both deduct fees as actual professional expenses for the same property must attach two attachments for this property to their joint return. If you fail to comply with this reporting requirement, the fees and benefits paid will not be tax deductible.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>This additional disclosure requirement was introduced to assist the tax administration in verifying that private landlords have correctly declared their rental income. For example, tenants who deduct rent as a professional expense must now add an attachment to their tax return as an individual person or as a corporate or legal entity. In that attachment, they must also provide information about the landlord: surname, first name and full address, national registration number or company number.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The administration has indicated that write-offs are not considered fees and therefore should not be included on the new Standard Form 270 MLH.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>No</strong></span><span><strong>270</strong> MLH attachment should be added in the following cases:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>when the rental agreement is<strong> registered free of charge</strong>. </span>In this case, rent cannot be deducted as a professional expense.<span style=""text-align: justify;"">  </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">When a rental agreement is registered free of charge, it is assumed that the property is for residential use only and therefore not used for the professional activity. </span>An exception applies when the property is leased for the sole purpose of providing housing for one or more employees or company directors and possibly their families pursuant to a legal or contractual obligation.<span style=""text-align: justify;"">  </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">The rent may then still be deducted as a professional expense, on condition that the attachment is included with the tax return.</span></li>
<li><span style=""text-align: justify;""></span><span>when an <strong>invoice</strong> or <strong>document valid as such</strong> is issued for the rent or fees for a surface right, ground lease or other right of use in rem.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>when renting out a property with a <strong>lease agreement</strong> in accordance with the leasehold law or a similar foreign law limiting lease rates, that is being used for agricultural or horticultural purposes.</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>

Changes to European rules governing the size of companies,26/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>Recently, the European Commission published a Directive (EU 2023/2775 of 17 October 2023) adjusting the size criteria for undertakings, taking into account the inflation that has occurred in recent years.  This Directive has since been transposed into Belgian law.</span></p>
<p><span>The new criteria will enter into force for financial years commencing from 1 January 2024 onwards.  This means that companies will continue to be classified as small for longer.</span></p>
<p><span>The size of a company is not only important when determining the model of financial statements and reporting but it also has tax implications.  In many cases, small companies therefore enjoy favourable tax regimes, including: a reduced rate, investment deduction and liquidation reserves.</span></p>

Registratieverplichting Pijler II,24/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
 In 2021, the OECD (organization containing nearly 140 countries) detailed a plan to combat <strong>Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)</strong>. This plan contained two pillars, whereby “Pillar II” contains agreements on <strong>a global minimum level of taxation</strong>, thus ensuring that large multinationals always pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on their profits.
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">In 2022, in order to ensure that Pillar II rules are<strong> transposed into domestic law in the same way within the EU</strong> (creating a level playing field), the EU issued a Council Directive ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for <strong>multinational enterprise groups</strong> and<strong> large domestic groups in the Union.</strong> The directive has extended the scope of Pillar II to include large domestic groups – not only multinational groups.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">At the end of 2023, the EU directive was transposed into national Belgian law introducing a minimum tax for multinational companies and large domestic groups. This introduced the minimum tax at the Belgian level.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Application of Pillar II</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">The following groups are subject to the minimum tax rate of 15% and are <strong>within the scope of the Pillar II-legislation in Belgium</strong>: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>multinational enterprise groups (MNE groups) and large domestic groups;</li>
<li>with annual turnover of at least €750 million in two or more of the four reporting years preceding the reporting year tested;</li>
<li>with constituent entities* established in Belgium, regardless of whether the ultimate parent entity (UPE) is tax resident in Belgium or elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">* A constituent entity means any entity or permanent establishment of an in-scope group that is subject to the Pillar II rules.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Notification requirement</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">When subject to the minimum tax per Pillar II-legislation in Belgium, the group is subject to the notification requirement for CBE registration (‘Crossroads Bank of Enterprises’)</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How?</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>In order to be able to register with the CBE, the Multinational enterprise group (‘MNE’) or the large-scale national group must notify the FPS Finance using a notification form available on MyMinfin (online platform of the FPS Finance).</span></li>
<li><span> </span>After a complete notification, the group will be registered in the CBE and an e-mail with the group registration number will be send to the entity that notified the group.</li>
<li>In case of an incomplete notification, the Belgian tax authorities will contact the notifying entity to make the necessary amendments. The current legislation does not stipulate a specific penalty in case of late or incorrect filing. However, there could be further consequences due to the lack of a group registration number, such as being unable to submit a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) return within the deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>When?</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The notification should be made no later than 30 days after the start of the tax year for which the group of MNE or the large-scale national group falls within the scope of the law of 19 December 2023. For example, if the first fiscal year starts on 1 January 2025, the notification deadline is 30 January 2025.</span></li>
<li><span> </span>For those who are already subject to Pillar 2 in the meantime (e.g. from 1 January 2024), the first notification must take place no later than 45 days after the publication of the Royal Decree of 15 May 2024 in the Belgian Official Gazette. As the publication of this Royal Decree took place on 29 May 2024, the deadline would be 13 July 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""></span><strong><span>What?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">The notification requires detailed information about the group and is divided into four sections:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Group information (box I)</span><span>: The group's unique name, fiscal year, UPE address, contact details as well as whether the group is a large domestic group or a MNE group.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Consolidated financial statements (box II)</span>: Details of the financial statements, the consolidation standards used, the currency, where these financial statements have been published.</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ownership structure (box III)</span>: A list of all UPEs, Intermediate Parent Entities (IPEs), and Partially Owned Parent Entities (POPEs) and their status.</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Contact details (box IV)</span>: Information of the entity that will act as point of contact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Who?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">The notification must be made:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">where a single ultimate parent entity is established in Belgium: by that single ultimate parent entity</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span>where several ultimate parent entities are established in Belgium: by the ultimate parent entity designated as the authorised representative</li>
<li>where there is no ultimate parent entity and only one constituent entity is established in Belgium: by that single constituent entity</li>
<li>where there is no ultimate parent entity and several constituent entities are established in Belgium: by the constituent entity designated as authorised representative</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Note that a separate proxy form needs to be filled in to mandate the relevant parent or group entity.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Next steps for Belgium </span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Step 1:</strong></span> Determining whether the group qualifies as a multinational enterprise group or a large domestic group.<br>
</span><strong><span style=""text-decoration-line: underline;"">Step 2:</span></strong> Identifying the Belgian constituent entities and determining whether they are covered by Pillar II legislation.<br>
<strong><span style=""text-decoration-line: underline;"">Step 3:</span></strong> Verifying whether you have access to MyMinfin, as the notification should be filed through the MyMinfin portal.<br>
<strong><span style=""text-decoration-line: underline;"">Step 4:</span></strong> Gather the required information as per above.<br>
<span style=""text-decoration-line: underline;""><strong>Step 5:</strong></span> Complete and submit the Pillar two notification form electronically via the MyMinfin platform <strong>by 13 July 2024 </strong>(if the group is already subject to Pillar II).</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">In view of the deadline for the registration of groups subject to the Pillar II scheme of July 13, 2024, we recommend that you do the necessary as soon as possible.
