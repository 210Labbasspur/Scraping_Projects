Change procedure optional VAT liability,24/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In Belgium, any person who, other than in the exercise of his <strong>VAT taxable economic activity</strong>, has erected or acquired a <strong>""new"" building</strong> or <strong>part of a ""new"" building</strong> with application of VAT, has the right to opt for the status of coincidental VAT taxpayer when the latter wishes to sell this immovable property or to establish or (re)transfer a right in rem on it with application of VAT. One of the conditions is that the property is still considered ""new"" within the meaning of the VAT code, i.e. the transfer of the property or of the right in rem <strong>takes place no later than 31 December</strong> of the second year following the year of the first occupation or first use of the building or part of building in question.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The advantage of this <strong>optional VAT liability</strong> is that the VAT on the establishment or purchase of the real estate <strong>can be recovered</strong> in this way. The Belgian VAT administration requires certain notification and declaration formalities to be complied with in order for the optional VAT tax liability to be exercised, namely: </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>Prior to the sale</strong>, the seller is obliged to submit to the VAT authorities an advance declaration on paper (declaration no. 104.1);</span></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span><strong>An express statement</strong> of the intention to dispose of the property with VAT or to create or (re)transfer the immovable right in rem with the application of VAT must be included in the first deed concluded between the parties. When disposing of a property, this is usually the contract of sale (although it is accepted that this intention is concretised in a promise of sale). Upon submission of Declaration No 104.1, the transferor or transferee receives a file number from the VAT administration, which the notary includes in the deed of transfer or establishment. This file number provides assurance to the notary and the co-contractor that the sale is taking place under the VAT regime.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>After the sale</strong>, the seller must submit a special declaration (declaration no. 104.5) to the VAT administration. This declaration no. 104.5 shall be submitted within the month after the VAT has become due and must state the amount received from the buyer (taxable amount and VAT), the VAT deducted and the difference between the VAT due and deductible on the part of the seller (or transferor). The VAT balance will have to be paid or refunded, as the case may be.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In response to the administrative burden these formalities imposed on the VAT administration, it was decided to <strong>simplify and modernise</strong> the aforementioned procedure.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The <strong>obligation to submit</strong> prior declaration no. 104.1 will be abolished without further ado. The follow-up of real estate transactions with application of VAT will henceforth be done <strong>on the basis of the first deed between the parties</strong> showing the transferor's intention to apply VAT to the sale or on the basis of the notarial deed between the parties. Thus, the aforementioned step 1 in the administrative procedure will be abolished. However, step 2 (entry of intention to apply VAT) and step 3 (filing of special declaration (declaration no. 104.5)) remain valid</span></p>

Changes to European rules governing the size of companies,26/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>Recently, the European Commission published a Directive (EU 2023/2775 of 17 October 2023) adjusting the size criteria for undertakings, taking into account the inflation that has occurred in recent years.  This Directive has since been transposed into Belgian law.</span></p>
<p><span>The new criteria will enter into force for financial years commencing from 1 January 2024 onwards.  This means that companies will continue to be classified as small for longer.</span></p>
<p><span>The size of a company is not only important when determining the model of financial statements and reporting but it also has tax implications.  In many cases, small companies therefore enjoy favourable tax regimes, including: a reduced rate, investment deduction and liquidation reserves.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>

Tax deductibility of rental charges,19/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>From the assessment year 2024 onwards</span></strong><span>, a sole proprietorship or company can no longer deduct, for tax purposes, the rent paid for real estate used for professional purposes or the fee for the use of property rights (such as ground lease, surface rights, usufruct and easements) without completing additional formalities. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>From now on, you must attach a <strong>form 270 MLH per property,</strong> to your income tax return in order to deduct the rent or fee paid for tax purposes.  The form should communicate the following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>the location of the property</span></li>
<li><span> </span>the charge paid, and</li>
<li>the amount to be deducted for tax purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>If you pay an overall fee for several undeveloped plots, one form will suffice. Spouses or legal cohabitants who are taxed together and who both deduct fees as actual professional expenses for the same property must attach two attachments for this property to their joint return. If you fail to comply with this reporting requirement, the fees and benefits paid will not be tax deductible.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>This additional disclosure requirement was introduced to assist the tax administration in verifying that private landlords have correctly declared their rental income. For example, tenants who deduct rent as a professional expense must now add an attachment to their tax return as an individual person or as a corporate or legal entity. In that attachment, they must also provide information about the landlord: surname, first name and full address, national registration number or company number.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The administration has indicated that write-offs are not considered fees and therefore should not be included on the new Standard Form 270 MLH.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>No</strong></span><span><strong>270</strong> MLH attachment should be added in the following cases:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>when the rental agreement is<strong> registered free of charge</strong>. </span>In this case, rent cannot be deducted as a professional expense.<span style=""text-align: justify;"">  </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">When a rental agreement is registered free of charge, it is assumed that the property is for residential use only and therefore not used for the professional activity. </span>An exception applies when the property is leased for the sole purpose of providing housing for one or more employees or company directors and possibly their families pursuant to a legal or contractual obligation.<span style=""text-align: justify;"">  </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">The rent may then still be deducted as a professional expense, on condition that the attachment is included with the tax return.</span></li>
<li><span style=""text-align: justify;""></span><span>when an <strong>invoice</strong> or <strong>document valid as such</strong> is issued for the rent or fees for a surface right, ground lease or other right of use in rem.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>when renting out a property with a <strong>lease agreement</strong> in accordance with the leasehold law or a similar foreign law limiting lease rates, that is being used for agricultural or horticultural purposes.</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In your personal income tax return, do not forget to tick the 1072-92 and/or 2072-62 box when adding form 270 MLH.  These codes can be found in box XIII, subsection E. </span>If you have any additional questions or comments about this, please contact us.

Registratieverplichting Pijler II,24/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
 In 2021, the OECD (organization containing nearly 140 countries) detailed a plan to combat <strong>Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)</strong>. This plan contained two pillars, whereby “Pillar II” contains agreements on <strong>a global minimum level of taxation</strong>, thus ensuring that large multinationals always pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on their profits.
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">In 2022, in order to ensure that Pillar II rules are<strong> transposed into domestic law in the same way within the EU</strong> (creating a level playing field), the EU issued a Council Directive ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for <strong>multinational enterprise groups</strong> and<strong> large domestic groups in the Union.</strong> The directive has extended the scope of Pillar II to include large domestic groups – not only multinational groups.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">At the end of 2023, the EU directive was transposed into national Belgian law introducing a minimum tax for multinational companies and large domestic groups. This introduced the minimum tax at the Belgian level.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Application of Pillar II</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">The following groups are subject to the minimum tax rate of 15% and are <strong>within the scope of the Pillar II-legislation in Belgium</strong>: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>multinational enterprise groups (MNE groups) and large domestic groups;</li>
<li>with annual turnover of at least €750 million in two or more of the four reporting years preceding the reporting year tested;</li>
<li>with constituent entities* established in Belgium, regardless of whether the ultimate parent entity (UPE) is tax resident in Belgium or elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">* A constituent entity means any entity or permanent establishment of an in-scope group that is subject to the Pillar II rules.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Notification requirement</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">When subject to the minimum tax per Pillar II-legislation in Belgium, the group is subject to the notification requirement for CBE registration (‘Crossroads Bank of Enterprises’)</span></p>

<p><strong><span>How?</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>In order to be able to register with the CBE, the Multinational enterprise group (‘MNE’) or the large-scale national group must notify the FPS Finance using a notification form available on MyMinfin (online platform of the FPS Finance).</span></li>
<li><span> </span>After a complete notification, the group will be registered in the CBE and an e-mail with the group registration number will be send to the entity that notified the group.</li>
<li>In case of an incomplete notification, the Belgian tax authorities will contact the notifying entity to make the necessary amendments. The current legislation does not stipulate a specific penalty in case of late or incorrect filing. However, there could be further consequences due to the lack of a group registration number, such as being unable to submit a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) return within the deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>

<li><span>The notification should be made no later than 30 days after the start of the tax year for which the group of MNE or the large-scale national group falls within the scope of the law of 19 December 2023. For example, if the first fiscal year starts on 1 January 2025, the notification deadline is 30 January 2025.</span></li>
<li><span> </span>For those who are already subject to Pillar 2 in the meantime (e.g. from 1 January 2024), the first notification must take place no later than 45 days after the publication of the Royal Decree of 15 May 2024 in the Belgian Official Gazette. As the publication of this Royal Decree took place on 29 May 2024, the deadline would be 13 July 2024.</li>

The importance of advance payments for both partnerships and sole traders.,05/03/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<span style=""line-height: 120%;""></span>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background: white; color: black;"">Tax prepayments are important for both sole traders and corporations to maintain financial stability and avoid unnecessary tax increases. In 2024, this practice remains relevant for all taxpayers. Let's take a closer look at why prepayments are so essential and how taxpayers can take advantage of them.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>Tax increase for insufficient prepayments</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>For companies</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies that fail to pay enough in advance will face a tax increase. The multiplier rate for insufficient prepayments will rise <strong>in corporate tax from 6.75% (income year 2023) to 9% (income year 2024, assessment year 2025). </strong></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> </strong>There will be no increase for the first three financial years of a small company (Art. 1:24, §1 to 6 CCA).  However, prepayment in this particular case does allow you to account for future liabilities, which can be beneficial for your available cash. (see tip)</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>For sole traders</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Sole traders will also face tax increases if they fail to make sufficient prepayments on time.  The multiplier rate will increase <strong>in personal income tax from 4.5% (income year 2023) to 9% (income year 2024, assessment year 2025).</strong>  Which is a significant increase for these taxpayers.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>The importance of timely and sufficient prepayments<br>
</span></strong><em>Avoid tax increases</em></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">By making timely prepayments, taxpayers can avoid or reduce a tax increase. The increase is not tax-deductible and can be a significant financial burden.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>Cash flow benefit</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">By making timely and regular prepayments, taxpayers spread the impact of income tax on their cash flow.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>Excessive prepayments</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span><br>
</span></strong>Did you fail to achieve the expected results and prepaid too much as a result? Will prepayments made then be lost or do you have to wait for the tax bill to recover these funds?  No, you can make a change of destination of your prepayments until 31 March of the following year (when the financial year equals the calendar year). You can carry forward (possibly partially) the prepayment to next financial year and/or claim an early refund. A combination of both, transfer and repay, is also possible.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>TIP: Maintain your financial reserves and/or cash flow for your investments or future projects</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span></span></strong>Finance your prepayments with a loan from your financial institution.  This way, you will not only avoid unnecessary tax increases, but also optimise your reserves and available cash flow.  You can use these funds for investments, projects, and contingencies. These loans are available at a cheaper rate, where you spread repayment over 12 months.  The interest paid is also a tax-deductible expense.To benefit from the 12% tax benefit, it is advisable to submit your application to the bank before the end of March.</p>
