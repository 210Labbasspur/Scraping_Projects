Tax deductibility of rental charges,19/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>From the assessment year 2024 onwards</span></strong><span>, a sole proprietorship or company can no longer deduct, for tax purposes, the rent paid for real estate used for professional purposes or the fee for the use of property rights (such as ground lease, surface rights, usufruct and easements) without completing additional formalities. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>From now on, you must attach a <strong>form 270 MLH per property,</strong> to your income tax return in order to deduct the rent or fee paid for tax purposes.  The form should communicate the following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>the location of the property</span></li>
<li><span> </span>the charge paid, and</li>
<li>the amount to be deducted for tax purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>If you pay an overall fee for several undeveloped plots, one form will suffice. Spouses or legal cohabitants who are taxed together and who both deduct fees as actual professional expenses for the same property must attach two attachments for this property to their joint return. If you fail to comply with this reporting requirement, the fees and benefits paid will not be tax deductible.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>This additional disclosure requirement was introduced to assist the tax administration in verifying that private landlords have correctly declared their rental income. For example, tenants who deduct rent as a professional expense must now add an attachment to their tax return as an individual person or as a corporate or legal entity. In that attachment, they must also provide information about the landlord: surname, first name and full address, national registration number or company number.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The administration has indicated that write-offs are not considered fees and therefore should not be included on the new Standard Form 270 MLH.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>No</strong></span><span><strong>270</strong> MLH attachment should be added in the following cases:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>when the rental agreement is<strong> registered free of charge</strong>. </span>In this case, rent cannot be deducted as a professional expense.<span style=""text-align: justify;"">  </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">When a rental agreement is registered free of charge, it is assumed that the property is for residential use only and therefore not used for the professional activity. </span>An exception applies when the property is leased for the sole purpose of providing housing for one or more employees or company directors and possibly their families pursuant to a legal or contractual obligation.<span style=""text-align: justify;"">  </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">The rent may then still be deducted as a professional expense, on condition that the attachment is included with the tax return.</span></li>
<li><span style=""text-align: justify;""></span><span>when an <strong>invoice</strong> or <strong>document valid as such</strong> is issued for the rent or fees for a surface right, ground lease or other right of use in rem.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>when renting out a property with a <strong>lease agreement</strong> in accordance with the leasehold law or a similar foreign law limiting lease rates, that is being used for agricultural or horticultural purposes.</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In your personal income tax return, do not forget to tick the 1072-92 and/or 2072-62 box when adding form 270 MLH.  These codes can be found in box XIII, subsection E. </span>If you have any additional questions or comments about this, please contact us.

Change procedure optional VAT liability,24/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In Belgium, any person who, other than in the exercise of his <strong>VAT taxable economic activity</strong>, has erected or acquired a <strong>""new"" building</strong> or <strong>part of a ""new"" building</strong> with application of VAT, has the right to opt for the status of coincidental VAT taxpayer when the latter wishes to sell this immovable property or to establish or (re)transfer a right in rem on it with application of VAT. One of the conditions is that the property is still considered ""new"" within the meaning of the VAT code, i.e. the transfer of the property or of the right in rem <strong>takes place no later than 31 December</strong> of the second year following the year of the first occupation or first use of the building or part of building in question.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The advantage of this <strong>optional VAT liability</strong> is that the VAT on the establishment or purchase of the real estate <strong>can be recovered</strong> in this way. The Belgian VAT administration requires certain notification and declaration formalities to be complied with in order for the optional VAT tax liability to be exercised, namely: </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>Prior to the sale</strong>, the seller is obliged to submit to the VAT authorities an advance declaration on paper (declaration no. 104.1);</span></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span><strong>An express statement</strong> of the intention to dispose of the property with VAT or to create or (re)transfer the immovable right in rem with the application of VAT must be included in the first deed concluded between the parties. When disposing of a property, this is usually the contract of sale (although it is accepted that this intention is concretised in a promise of sale). Upon submission of Declaration No 104.1, the transferor or transferee receives a file number from the VAT administration, which the notary includes in the deed of transfer or establishment. This file number provides assurance to the notary and the co-contractor that the sale is taking place under the VAT regime.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>After the sale</strong>, the seller must submit a special declaration (declaration no. 104.5) to the VAT administration. This declaration no. 104.5 shall be submitted within the month after the VAT has become due and must state the amount received from the buyer (taxable amount and VAT), the VAT deducted and the difference between the VAT due and deductible on the part of the seller (or transferor). The VAT balance will have to be paid or refunded, as the case may be.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In response to the administrative burden these formalities imposed on the VAT administration, it was decided to <strong>simplify and modernise</strong> the aforementioned procedure.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The <strong>obligation to submit</strong> prior declaration no. 104.1 will be abolished without further ado. The follow-up of real estate transactions with application of VAT will henceforth be done <strong>on the basis of the first deed between the parties</strong> showing the transferor's intention to apply VAT to the sale or on the basis of the notarial deed between the parties. Thus, the aforementioned step 1 in the administrative procedure will be abolished. However, step 2 (entry of intention to apply VAT) and step 3 (filing of special declaration (declaration no. 104.5)) remain valid</span></p>

Changes to European rules governing the size of companies,26/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>Recently, the European Commission published a Directive (EU 2023/2775 of 17 October 2023) adjusting the size criteria for undertakings, taking into account the inflation that has occurred in recent years.  This Directive has since been transposed into Belgian law.</span></p>
<p><span>The new criteria will enter into force for financial years commencing from 1 January 2024 onwards.  This means that companies will continue to be classified as small for longer.</span></p>
<p><span>The size of a company is not only important when determining the model of financial statements and reporting but it also has tax implications.  In many cases, small companies therefore enjoy favourable tax regimes, including: a reduced rate, investment deduction and liquidation reserves.</span></p>

The importance of advance payments for both partnerships and sole traders.,05/03/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<span style=""line-height: 120%;""></span>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background: white; color: black;"">Tax prepayments are important for both sole traders and corporations to maintain financial stability and avoid unnecessary tax increases. In 2024, this practice remains relevant for all taxpayers. Let's take a closer look at why prepayments are so essential and how taxpayers can take advantage of them.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>Tax increase for insufficient prepayments</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>For companies</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies that fail to pay enough in advance will face a tax increase. The multiplier rate for insufficient prepayments will rise <strong>in corporate tax from 6.75% (income year 2023) to 9% (income year 2024, assessment year 2025). </strong></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> </strong>There will be no increase for the first three financial years of a small company (Art. 1:24, §1 to 6 CCA).  However, prepayment in this particular case does allow you to account for future liabilities, which can be beneficial for your available cash. (see tip)</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>For sole traders</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Sole traders will also face tax increases if they fail to make sufficient prepayments on time.  The multiplier rate will increase <strong>in personal income tax from 4.5% (income year 2023) to 9% (income year 2024, assessment year 2025).</strong>  Which is a significant increase for these taxpayers.</li>

</span></strong><em>Avoid tax increases</em></p>
<ul>

</span></strong>Did you fail to achieve the expected results and prepaid too much as a result? Will prepayments made then be lost or do you have to wait for the tax bill to recover these funds?  No, you can make a change of destination of your prepayments until 31 March of the following year (when the financial year equals the calendar year). You can carry forward (possibly partially) the prepayment to next financial year and/or claim an early refund. A combination of both, transfer and repay, is also possible.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span></span></strong>Finance your prepayments with a loan from your financial institution.  This way, you will not only avoid unnecessary tax increases, but also optimise your reserves and available cash flow.  You can use these funds for investments, projects, and contingencies. These loans are available at a cheaper rate, where you spread repayment over 12 months.  The interest paid is also a tax-deductible expense.To benefit from the 12% tax benefit, it is advisable to submit your application to the bank before the end of March.</p>

VAT in the digital age (ViDA),17/07/2023,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<span style=""line-height: 120%;""><strong></strong></span>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The current<strong> EU VAT system for intra-EU trade</strong> is almost 30 years old and, despite some recent improvements, has not kept pace with technological advances, the digital economy, changes in business models, or globalisation. On 8 December 2022, the European Commission proposed a series of measures to modernize the EU's Value-Added Tax (VAT) system. The proposal is aimed to make VAT work better for businesses, more resilient to fraud by embracing and promoting digitalization.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The VAT in the Digital Age package takes full advantage of technological and digital advances to deliver on an updated VAT system. In a nutshell, the European Commission has put forward proposals for:</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>1. A move to real-time digital reporting based on e-invoicing for businesses that operate cross-border in the EU and a harmonised framework for domestic transactions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The new system introduces <strong>real-time, transaction-based digital reporting</strong> for VAT purposes, based on e-invoicing. Once operational, the system will give Member States valuable information they need to <strong>control cross-border transactions and step up the fight against cross-border VAT fraud</strong>, while reducing administrative and compliance costs for businesses. To make the best use of this data for VAT control and anti-fraud purposes, Member States will also be equipped with the appropriate administrative cooperation tools.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>2. Updated VAT rules for passenger transport and short-term accommodation platforms</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under the new rules, platform economy operators themselves will be deemed <strong>responsible for collecting VAT when service providers</strong> do not (because they are, for example, a small business not usually required to register for VAT) and for remitting this VAT to tax authorities. This, together with other clarifications, will ensure a uniform approach across all Member States and contribute to a more level playing field between online and traditional accommodation and transport services. It also makes life simpler for SMEs using the platforms as they will no longer need to understand and ensure compliance with VAT rules, often in other Member States.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>3. The introduction of a single VAT registration across the EU</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Building on the already existing ‘One Stop Shop' model for e-commerce traders, the EU Commission’s proposal will further reduce the circumstances in which businesses that want to sell to consumers in more than one Member State have to register in other Member States. With this reform, traders who operate cross-border can opt to register in only one Member State for their sales to consumers across the EU and for their transfers of goods for storage in other Member States. After registration in <strong>one Member State</strong>, they will then be able to fulfil their VAT obligations via a single online portal and interact solely with the tax administration of that Member State in one language, even though their sales are EU-wide. Smaller businesses, in particular those who want to scale-up, will benefit from the much simpler administration introduced by the new rules. The proposal also makes it mandatory for online platforms to register for the Import One Stop Shop which will further improve VAT compliance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Where are we now?</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The ViDA  proposals are likely to have a big impact for many businesses in the European Union. Currently, the ViDA is going through the consultation and legislative process at the EU level. In this regard, the EU Finance Ministers broadly agree with ViDA proposals. However, a call to delay the proposed timetable on e-invoicing and to further consider the rules on platform reforms was raised. Some EU Member States have also raised questions on the costs of the required IT investment. In July 2023, the EU Parliament called for 2-year delay on the measures.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>A final agreement and vote on the measures, their implementation and the timeline thereof is anticipate for the <strong>ECOFIN meeting of 17 October 2023</strong>. If the current timetable for implementation is kept and the first measure being implemented as of 1 January 2024, this will mean that businesses in the EU will have little time to adapt to the new rules. Although some delays and/or transitory measures are likely, businesses should prepare for the upcoming changes under ViDA.</span></p>

Digital VAT refund procedure for non-EU businesses,23/06/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Foreign VAT taxable persons without a Belgian VAT registration number, can apply for a refund of Belgian VAT incurred in the framework of their economic activity. This VAT refund procedure exists for EU-established as well as non-EU established businesses. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Whereas EU-established businesses could submit their EU VAT refund claim electronically in the Member State where they are established, non-EU established businesses were obliged to file their refund claim for Belgian VAT on paper in Belgium. Needless to say that this paper based procedure was inefficient. This will change. From 1 July 2022 the application for the refund of  Belgian VAT by non-EU established businesses can also be filed electronically, making it easier for non-EU established VAT taxable persons to claim back Belgian VAT incurred.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>As a reminder, we reiterate a number of basic conditions for the VAT refund claim. Non-EU established businesses are entitled to recover Belgian VAT if:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>the claimant is not registered or liable to register for VAT purposes in Belgium;</span></li>
<li><span> </span>the claimant is not deemed to be established in Belgium;</li>
<li>the claimant has not provided any taxable supplies in Belgium (exceptions apply);</li>
<li>a minimum refund amount is reclaimed (If the refund application relates to a refund period of less than one calendar year, but at least three calendar months, the minimum refund amount is EUR 400. If the refund application is for a calendar year or the remaining part of a calendar year, the minimum amount is EUR 50).</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Furthermore, input VAT refund limitations can apply depending on the nature of the cost. No VAT refund is allowed for VAT on:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>manufactured tabaco</span></li>
<li><span> </span>alcoholic beverages (few exceptions apply)</li>
<li>hotel accommodation, meals and beverages (few exceptions apply)</li>
<li>reception costs.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>A partial VAT refund will be allowed for car costs as the VAT refund for these costs is limited to maximum 50% of Belgian VAT incurred. This also applies to maintenance, repair and fuel costs in Belgium.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The deadlines for submitting and processing the electronic refund application remain unchanged. The request (with all required data) must be submitted by 30 September of the calendar year following the year in which the VAT became chargeable.</span></p>

Registratieverplichting Pijler II,24/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
 In 2021, the OECD (organization containing nearly 140 countries) detailed a plan to combat <strong>Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)</strong>. This plan contained two pillars, whereby “Pillar II” contains agreements on <strong>a global minimum level of taxation</strong>, thus ensuring that large multinationals always pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on their profits.
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">In 2022, in order to ensure that Pillar II rules are<strong> transposed into domestic law in the same way within the EU</strong> (creating a level playing field), the EU issued a Council Directive ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for <strong>multinational enterprise groups</strong> and<strong> large domestic groups in the Union.</strong> The directive has extended the scope of Pillar II to include large domestic groups – not only multinational groups.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">At the end of 2023, the EU directive was transposed into national Belgian law introducing a minimum tax for multinational companies and large domestic groups. This introduced the minimum tax at the Belgian level.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Application of Pillar II</span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>multinational enterprise groups (MNE groups) and large domestic groups;</li>
<li>with annual turnover of at least €750 million in two or more of the four reporting years preceding the reporting year tested;</li>
<li>with constituent entities* established in Belgium, regardless of whether the ultimate parent entity (UPE) is tax resident in Belgium or elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">* A constituent entity means any entity or permanent establishment of an in-scope group that is subject to the Pillar II rules.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How?</span></strong> </p>
<ul>

<li>In case of an incomplete notification, the Belgian tax authorities will contact the notifying entity to make the necessary amendments. The current legislation does not stipulate a specific penalty in case of late or incorrect filing. However, there could be further consequences due to the lack of a group registration number, such as being unable to submit a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) return within the deadline.</li>

Reimbursement of home-fueled electricity for company cars,23/06/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Benefit in kind? </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As everyone knows, a benefit in kind is taken into account in the name of the employee/director for the private use (including commuting) of a car put at his disposal. This benefit in kind also includes the fuel that is paid with a fuel card provided by the employer/company.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, the reimbursement of electricity that is refueled at home cannot simply be equated with a fuel card. In this case, indeed there is no question of fuel/electricity ‘made available’ by the employer/company.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thus, in principle, a separate benefit in kind must be taxed for the reimbursed electricity for the amount reimbursed insofar as this relates to commuter traffic or purely private displacements. For commuting, an employee can however benefit from a tax-free amount of EUR 420.00. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Administrative tolerance</strong><br>
However, due to an administrative tolerance, no separate benefit in kind should be taken into account if the following conditions are cumulatively fulfilled.  </p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The reimbursement of home-fueled electricity is included in the employer's/company's car policy;</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The charging station at home is equipped with a specific communication system that communicates to the employer/company how much electricity is being consumed;</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The employer/company itself is responsible for the installation of the charging station.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In connection with the second condition, the Minister has meanwhile nuanced that another form of communication can also be used, insofar as this can be verified, for example by means of an intermediate counter. It is of course the intention that only the electricity refueled for the company car will be reimbursed. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
The last has not yet been said about this topic. The Minister has therefore announced that a Circular is on its way.

Student workers: everything you need to know,05/05/2023,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Student workers are <strong>an important part</strong> <strong>of the Belgian labour market</strong>. Every year, thousands of students work in <strong>various industries</strong>, such as retail and hospitality. With summer approaching, the number of students working will also increase again. Before employing students, it is essential to be aware of the relevant regulations and make the proper preparations. In this blog, we would like to give you the key points to consider when planning to employ students:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Age and study requirements</span></strong><span>: Working students in Belgium must be at least 15 years old. They must be enrolled as a student at an accredited educational institution, such as a high school, college or university. It is important to check students' proof of enrolment and make sure they meet these requirements.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2. </strong></span><strong>Working conditions and hours</strong>: As an employer, it is important to be aware of the specific working conditions and hours that apply to student workers. In Belgium, working students are allowed to work up to 600 hours per calendar year at a solidarity contribution (social security) on their gross pay of 2.71% for the student and 5.43% for the employer. In addition, no withholding tax is deducted from a student worker's pay. When a student works more than 600 hours, in principle, the normal rules that apply to any other employee in your company will apply. Thus, you will pay a higher employer's contribution on their gross pay, the social security contribution of 13.07% will apply, and the rules regarding withholding tax will apply.</p>
<p><span><strong>3. </strong></span><strong>Work on Sundays and public holidays:</strong> In principle, employees under 18 years of age may not be employed on Sundays or public holidays or work between 8pm and 6am. However, exceptions to this have been defined for certain sectors, such as the hospitality industry. For example, in the hospitality industry, young people under 18 are allowed to work on Sundays and public holidays every two weeks if they receive an extra day of rest in exchange. In the case of night work by a young person under the age of 18, there must be a continuous rest period of 12 hours between the end of the working day and the resumption of work the following day.</p>
<p><span><strong>4. </strong></span><strong>Employment contract:</strong> Student workers are required to have a written employment contract. This is regardless of the length of the employment contract. This contract must contain well-defined inforation, such as the duration of the contract, salary, working hours and job description. It is important to note that the first 3 working days of the contract are always considered probationary, even if there is no specific probation clause in the contract. During this period, both the employer and the student may terminate the contract without notice or compensation.</p>
<p><span><strong>5. </strong></span><strong>DIMONA declaration:</strong> As with other employees, it is required by law to file a DIMONA declaration before the start of employment. In the event of a late declaration for a student, the student cannot work as a student worker for the remainder of the quarter or until the end of the employment contract and is automatically treated as a regular employee by the NSSO.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>There are some situations in which a student is not eligible to work as a student worker:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Work experience of more than 12 months</span></strong><span>: If a student has already worked continuously with the same employer for more than 12 months, they can no longer work as a student worker with the same employer. However, they can still work as a student worker with another employer.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Mandatory school attendance</span></strong><span>: Working students may not have work hours at times when they are required to be present at school on a mandatory basis. This is to ensure that students have sufficient time for their studies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>School leavers after summer vacation</span></strong><span>: After 30 September, school leavers can no longer work as student workers. This gives them the opportunity to focus on finding full-time employment or further studies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Receiving unemployment benefits</span></strong><span>: If a student is receiving unemployment benefits, they cannot work as a student worker. This is because the student is considered actively seeking full-time employment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unpaid internships as part of a programme of study</strong><span>: If a student takes an unpaid internship as a required part of their programme of study, they cannot receive a student contract for this internship. In that case, different rules and guidelines apply to the internship.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Reduced curriculum or night school</span></strong><span>: If a student attends only night school or education with a reduced curriculum, restrictions or prohibitions may apply to working as a student worker. These rules may vary depending on the specific situation and educational institution.</span></li>
</ul>

Amendment of the articles of association to the new Company Code,23/06/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #131313;"">As you probably know, on 1 May 2019, <strong>the new Companies and Associations Code</strong> (abbreviated to CAC) entered into force. This modernization of the regulatory framework for companies sought to make <strong>Belgian company law more flexible and simpler</strong>. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #131313;"">In concrete terms, the amendment of the CAC means that, since 1 May 2019, shareholders and founders of companies have a <strong>great deal of freedom</strong> to determine the arrangements and rules within the company. The number of company forms has also been <strong>drastically reduced</strong>. This means that some of the 'old' legal entity forms will disappear and/or have to be converted into one of the legal entity forms under the new Belgian CAC before 1 January 2024. Also know that the mandatory provisions of the new company <strong>law are applicable since 1 January 2020! </strong></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: #131313;""><br>
Possible opportunities  </span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #131313;"">You can always opt to only have <strong>the minimum required conversions</strong> made to your<strong> existing legal entity</strong>. However, since the change in the Belgian company code, a Belgian company is more than ever a <strong>'tailor-made' </strong>product and can be adapted to your (professional and private) needs. For example, different types of shares can be created, different voting rights or profit rights can be allocated to different categories of shares/shareholders, there is more freedom to modulate the transfer of shares, there is a more extensive possibility to pay out interim dividends, there is more room for family enterprises to respond to family wishes and needs, etc. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: #131313;"">Action to take!</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #131313;"">Companies incorporated <strong>before May 1, 2019</strong> will have to have their articles of association amended <strong>by December 31, 2023</strong> at the latest in order to <strong>convert them in accordance</strong> with the new CAC and in certain cases the shareholders' agreements and the management and directors' agreements will also have to be amended.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #131313;"">Companies that have still not taken action <strong>after December 31, 2023</strong> will be converted by operation of law into the legal form <strong>closest to the old form</strong>. Due to this automatic conversion (without amendment of the articles of association) you cannot, of course, take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new rules. In addition, if you fail to comply with the transposition deadline, you as a director may be held liable for any damages resulting from this negligence.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #131313;"">It is therefore important to tackle <strong>the transformation of your company</strong> in good time and to examine the possible opportunities of the new rules. The final conversion date seems far off, but it is not in view of the administrative process that must be completed in the context of the conversion (identifying opportunities, adjusting the articles of association, notarial ratification (where necessary)).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: #131313;"">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #131313;""> So take action as soon as possible in order to be ready with the adjustment in time. We are happy to assist you with the transformation of your company to the new CAC (where necessary in collaboration with our or your notary). You can always contact your contact person at Crowe for this. </span></p>

Lump sum valuation benefit in kind electricity and heating,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>The benefit in kind for the free provision of electricity and heating has been valued on a lump sum basis for many years. This has partly come to an end as from 1 January 2022.</p>
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Existing rules</strong>  </p>
<p>When an employer or company provides electricity and heating to its employees or directors free of charge, a taxable benefit in kind must be taken into account. This taxable benefit is estimated on a lump sum basis.</p>
<p>For the income year 2022 the following amounts apply: </p>
<p><strong><br>
For electricity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Directors and other executive staff:<span> </span>EUR 1.060,00</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Other employees:<span> </span>EUR 480,00</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>For heating:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Directors and other executive staff:<span> </span>EUR 2.130,00</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Other employees:<span> </span>EUR 960,00</li>
</ul>
<p>When the employee or director pays a personal contribution, this may be deducted from the amount of the taxable benefit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>New rules   </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style=""text-align: justify;"">The amounts remain unchanged, although the lump sum valuation will only apply when the person providing the free electricity and heating also provides free housing.  In other words, the benefit for the free provision of heating and/or electricity will only be estimated on a lump sum basis provided that heating and/or electricity is used in a property that the same employer or company puts at the disposal of the employee or director. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If this is not the case, the benefit for the free electricity and heating must be valued at its actual <strong>value</strong>. A personal contribution may still be deducted.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The regulation was amended after a ruling was issued confirming that the lump sum valuation could also apply within the context of so-called cafeteria plans whereby employees are offered the possibility, as part of such a plan, to subscribe to the supply of heating and/or electricity up to a certain budget and whereby they are then only taxed on the lump sum amounts. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><br>
Pain points of the new regulation  </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The question arises whether this new regulation passes the test of the principle of equal treatment.  Indeed, from now on, a distinction is made depending on whether or not the employee or director also receives free housing.  A distinction is only justified if it is based on an objective criterion and is reasonably justified.  This justification is currently lacking. In addition, practical problems arise in connection with determining the actual value.  If there is no separate counter, no distinction can be made between private and business consumption.   And what if there are solar panels?  At the moment it is unclear whether the cost of these must also be included and to what extent. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The adjustment of the lump sum valuation of the benefit for electricity and heating not only leads to probable inequality but also to legal uncertainty and probably also numerous discussions with the tax authorities.

Electronic invoicing,19/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Following the postponement of the introduction of mandatory <strong>electronic invoicing</strong> at the European level as part of the <strong>ViDA reforms</strong>, Belgium is implementing general mandatory electronic <strong>invoicing for B2B transactions from 1 January 2026</strong>. The move to mandatory electronic invoicing is important to reduce the VAT gap, the difference between what the government should receive in VAT revenue and what the government actually receives, and to further a reduction in the administrative burden for businesses.</span></p>

The tax regulation of charging stations,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With the general greening of mobility, the taxation rules could not stay behind.  Therefore measures were introduced to stimulate investment in charging stations. What follows is a high-level overview of the key elements in the field of income tax and VAT.  </p>
<p><strong><br>
Corporate income tax </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies that invest in new charging stations for electric cars between September 1, 2021 and August 31, 2024 can benefit from an increased cost deduction. This actually comes down to an increased depreciation and amounts to <strong>200%</strong> for investments as from September 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022 and <strong>150%</strong> for investments as from January 1, 2023 to August 31, 2024. The <strong>increased cost deduction</strong> only applies to fixed charging stations and not to charging cables. Additional costs such as transport costs, installation costs, study and expertise costs are also eligible for the increased depreciation.</p>
<p>Conditions are that the charging station:</p>
<ul>
<li>is acquired in <strong>new condition</strong></li>
<li>is<strong> publicly accessible </strong>during the company's usual opening hours or closing times; these must   then be reported to the FPS Finance, which publishes these on a website so that everyone can consult the accessibility</li>
<li>is <strong>digitally linked to a management system</strong> that can control the charging time and charging capacity of the charging station</li>
<li>is <strong>depreciated</strong> on a straight-line basis over at least <strong>5 years</strong>, assuming a normal life of a charging station of 10 years.<br>
In addition, for SME companies, the increased cost deduction can be combined with the one-off investment deduction (still 25% until December 31, 2022).<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personal income tax</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The above-mentioned <strong>increased cost deduction</strong> also applies in the personal income tax for tax payers earning <strong>profits or gains.  </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
When a private individual purchases a home charging station between 1 September 2021 and 31 August 2024, he is entitled to a <strong>tax reduction</strong>.  This amounts to <strong>45% </strong>of the amount of the payments made for investments between 1 September 2021 and 31 December 2022, <strong>30%</strong> for investments between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2023 and <strong>15%</strong> for investments between 1 January 2024 and 31 August 2024.</p>
<p>Conditions are amongst others that the charging station</p>
<ul>
<li>is acquired in <strong>new condition</strong></li>
<li>is<strong> intelligent</strong>, meaning that it must be possible to control the charging time and capacity</li>
<li>must only make use of <strong>green electricity</strong></li>
<li>must be installed<strong> in or near the home</strong> of the tax payer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount that qualifies for the reduction is limited to EUR 1.500 per charging station and per taxpayer, and the reduction may only be requested for one taxable period. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>
VAT </strong></p>
<p>The VAT treatment of charging stations is included in Circ. 2021/C/113 of 13 December 2021 and can be summarised as follows.  </p>
<p>
<strong>1. Installation of the charging station </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>- Rate</strong><br>
<br>
The delivery and installation of a charging station (= charging stations + charging points) is considered as real estate work.  This work is subject to the reduced VAT rate of 6% if it is done on a private home that is more than 10 years old and that is primarily used for residential purposes.  Several conditions must be taken into account.  <br>
Deliveries that do not meet the set conditions fall under the normal VAT rate of 21%.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>- Deduction</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>a.<span> </span>Charging station installed at the company’s premises </strong><br>
A charging station installed at the company's premises is considered to be part of the company's electrical installation where there is a 100% VAT deduction, provided the station is used <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>exclusively for the economic activity of the company that has full right of deduction.  This is the case if it is only used by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directors and employees</li>
<li>Customers and suppliers of the company (regardless of payment or not</li>
<li>Third parties against payment.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>This also applies when the company rents the charging station on its site.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>b.<span> </span>Charging station installed at the employee’s home</strong><br>
A charging station that is installed at an employee's home is not part of the company's electrical installation. The following distinction must be made:<br>
<br>
<span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>i.<span> </span>The charging station is provided free of charge <br>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The deduction of VAT must be limited to the business use of the car, with the understanding that the general deduction limitation for cars of 50% does not apply here.</li>
<li>If the charging station leaves the company (e.g. when the employee moves and the charging stations remains behind), the employer must revise the VAT deducted as long as the 5-year revision period has not expired. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ii.<span> </span>The charging station is provided for a compensation (= in the case of a rental/purchase of the station by the employee from the employer, reduction of the net salary in exchange for making it available or within the framework of a cafeteria plan with a points system)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VAT will be charged on the compensation.  Consequently, there is no deduction limitation provided that the compensation corresponds to the 'normal' value.</li>
<li>When determining the normal value, the ratio professional/private use of the car must be taken into account.  <br>
<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.<span> </span>Consumption of electricity </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The VAT deduction should be limited in function of the ratio professional/private use of the car.  Here the general 50% limit does apply as the electricity is considered to be fuel.</li>
<li>If the electricity consumption can be measured separately for each vehicle, the right to deduct is further determined according to the deduction percentage of the vehicle.</li>
<li>If this is not the case, the deduction percentage is determined under the supervision of the administration. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The greening of mobility also has tax implications.  Each case must be examined carefully in order to apply the tax rules correctly.

Adjustments to the VVPR-bis regulation,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Law of January 21, 2022 regarding tax provisions (Belgian Official Gazette, January 28, 2022) has made a number of changes to the existing VVPR-bis regime.  This regime means that if certain conditions are met, dividends distributed by SME companies can benefit from a reduced withholding tax of 20% if they are distributed from the profit of the second financial year after that of the contribution and 15% if they are distributed from the profit of the third financial year. The amended regulation applies to <strong>dividends that are attributed or made payable as of 1 January 2022.</strong>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><br>
Pay-up obligation </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the conditions for the VVPR-bis regime is that the dividends must originate from new shares issued as from 1 July 2013 as compensation for a capital contribution <strong>paid up in cash</strong>. This pay-up must have been done at the time of the dividend payment.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following the entry into force of the new Company Code on May 1, 2019, the concept of 'capital' was abolished for a number of company forms. This has led to many private limited companies reducing their 'capital' to EUR 1 by, for example, an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The question then arose as to whether the capital of EUR 1 could continue to be classified as VVPR-bis capital and whether all dividends, including those from reserves prior to the capital reduction, could continue to benefit from the reduced withholding tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A ruling dated April 21, 2020 confirmed that the capital must be paid up at the time the dividend is attributed of paid “whereby the benefit of the reduced withholding tax cannot be denied due to the fact that the capital was not fully paid up at the time of conversion to a private limited company”. This meant that all future dividends could be paid out at the reduced rate and that the original contribution of EUR 18.550 did not have to be fully paid up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, this was beyond the reckoning of the government, which was of the opinion that the initially subscribed contribution must be fully paid up in order to be able to benefit from the VVPR-bis regime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The problem with this is that a company that has reduced its capital in the past, can never pay up its initial capital as it now only has EUR 1 capital.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That is why a <strong>temporary transitional regulation </strong>has now been introduced, which provides that companies that have reduced their contribution in good faith by means of an exemption from the pay up obligation between 1 May 2019 and 15 December 2021 , can still benefit from the VVPR-bis benefits, provided that they bring back their contribution to the initially subscribed amount by means of a cash contribution and this before 31 December 2022. This means that these companies will first have to carry out a new capital increase before being able to pay out dividends with application of the VVPR-bis benefits. Note that a later capital reduction does not constitute an obstacle to the VVPR-bis regime. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Waiting period </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The reduced withholding tax only applies after the expiry of a so-called waiting period.  Following the above, it has been determined that the waiting period to do a dividend payment is applicable on an ongoing basis<strong> as of the date of the initial contribution</strong> and not as of the date of the capital increase as previously envisaged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Non-preferential shares </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Another condition of the VVPR-bis regime is that the shares issued as a result of the contribution may not be preferential. In this regard, it is now stipulated that the shares may <strong>only be non-preferential with regard to the participation in the profits or the capital or the distribution of the equity</strong>.  Shares with multiple voting rights, on the other hand, are considered not to be preferential for the application of the VVPR-bis scheme.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In addition to the existing exclusions (for amounts contributed that originate from reserves 'locked up' in the past and amounts originating from a capital decrease in an affiliated or associated company), a new exclusion applies to amounts contributed that arise from a distribution of a liquidation reserve by an affiliated or associated company on which a reduced withholding tax of 5% was levied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
After a period of legal uncertainty in connection with a number of conditions for the application of the VVPR-bis regime, the Law of January 21, 2022 did introduce a number of clarifications.  Keeping the waiting period from the moment of the initial contribution is certainly one of them.  And also VVPR-bis companies that proceeded to an exemption from the obligation to pay up in full also know what to do before the end of the year.</p>

The liquidation reserve and modulating shareholder rights,23/12/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>For a number of years, SME companies can transfer (part of) their accounting profit after tax to a so-called liquidation reserve, provided a special tax of 10% is paid at the time of transfer.</p>
<h2>Advantage of the liquidation reserve </h2>
<p>In the event of a later liquidation, the accrued liquidation reserve can be distributed to the shareholders-natural persons tax-free. </p>
<p>In the event of the distribution of the liquidation reserve before the company’s liquidation but after a 5 year period, an additional 5% withholding tax shall be payable. But if the reserves are distributed within a 5 year period, an additional 17% withholding tax is payable for liquidation reserves established before tax year 2018 and 20% for liquidation reserves as from tax year 2018.</p>
<h2>What in case of mixed shareholding? </h2>
<p>As the exemption from withholding tax in the event of liquidation does not apply to corporate shareholders, which can apply a tax credit for any withholding tax and fully exempt the dividend received, it makes no sense to create a liquidation reserve and pay 10 % additional tax, if there are only corporate shareholder.</p>
<p>But what if at the start there were only shareholders-natural persons in the company and later on corporate shareholders join(ed)? </p>
<p>Distributions from the liquidation reserve will then accrue proportionally to the shareholders-natural persons and to the corporate shareholders, as a result of which the tax advantage of the reduced withholding tax is partly lost and the separate tax of 10% was in fact paid for nothing.</p>
<h2>How to solve? </h2>
<p>The new Company Code provides for the possibility to differentiate the rights attached to shares (voting and profit rights) in the articles of association. This means that, for example, one can create 2 types of shares, namely a category A being the shares held by natural persons and a category B being the shares held by companies. Furthermore, it can then be foreseen that all shares still are entitled to an equal share of the profit, but that dividends granted to shares A are allocated in priority from the liquidation reserves and dividends granted to shares B in preference from other reserves. In this way, the advantage of the reduced withholding tax associated with the liquidation reserves can be fully utilized.</p>
<p>The ruling commission recently approved this method in a specific case and sees no tax abuse in it as long as the amendment to the articles of association is implemented in order to facilitate the entry of new corporate shareholder. </p>
<h2>But reflect before you start!</h2>
<p>For companies with VVPR-bis capital (reduced withholding tax), the VVPR-bis advantage may be lost by modulating the rights attached to the shares. This advantage also consists in a reduction of the withholding tax on dividends allocated to the VVPR-bis shares, provided a number of conditions are met and a waiting period has been observed.</p>
<p>One of these conditions is that no preferential shares may be created. While this is not allowed according to the wordings of the law at the time of the capital increase, the Minister of Finance now seems to have taken the position that making shares preferential at a later date also leads to loss of the VVPR-bis advantage. There is therefore a risk that modulating the shares in the context of the liquidation reserve is regarded as creating preferential shares, as a result of which the VVPR-bis shares lose their favourable tax status.</p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>The possibility provided by the Company Code to modulate the rights attached to shares is an opportunity to fully utilize the tax advantage associated with the liquidation reserves, if corporate shareholders join the company at a later date. However, care must be taken that modulating the rights attached to shares is motivated by reasons other than tax, and that other tax advantages such as the VVPR-bis regime are not lost as a result. </p>

The investment deduction anno 2022,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a result of the corona pandemic, the investment deduction for SME companies was temporarily increased from 8% to 25% for investments made during a well-defined period.  In addition, there are still a number of special rates that are currently lower than the 25% rate and an investment deduction has been introduced for investments in a new category of assets.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Below you can find an overview.   </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span><strong><br>
Standard rate for SME</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As stated above, the standard rate for SME companies has been increased from 8% to 25% for qualifying investments made from 12 March 2020 to 31 December 2022.   <br>
Special rates for SME <br>
Further the following rates apply to SME companies:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">patents, environmentally friendly investments in research and development, energy-saving    investments and smoke extraction or ventilation systems in catering establishments: 13,5%</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">digital investments: 13,5%</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Investments in security: 20,5%.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since the standard rate is currently 25%, this higher rate can be applied.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Attention:</span></strong> if there are less than 20 employees, a spread deduction can be opted for in the case of energy-saving investments and investments in research and development.  This amounts to 20,5% of the depreciation on the investment.  Furthermore, for investments in research and development, it is also possible to opt for the (one-off or spread) tax credit.  This is then the nominal corporate tax rate applied on the same calculation basis as the investment deduction.  <br>
This must then be weighed against the application of the increased investment deduction of 25%.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Further note that for energy-saving investments and investments in research and development, an attestation must be requested.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally, an investment deduction of 3% applies to investments in reusable packaging, but no increase to 25% is foreseen.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><br>
Special rates for LARGE companies </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Large companies can still benefit from the following investment deductions without the increase to 25%:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Energy-saving investments: 13,5%</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Environmentally friendly investments in research and development: 13,5%</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Patents: 13,5%</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Smoke extraction or ventilation systems: 13,5%</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Reusable packaging: 3%</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The remarks on spread deduction, tax credit and request of attestations also apply.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>New investment deduction for ’green’ trucks </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For investments in green trucks a new temporary investment deduction has been introduced. The purchase of new carbon emission free trucks, the installation of refuelling infrastructure for blue, green or turquoise hydrogen and the installation of electric charging infrastructure for carbon emission free trucks can count on a 35% investment deduction for investments made in 2022.  However, the total investment deduction may not exceed EUR 60.000.000,00.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A green truck is then a truck, trailer or semi-trailer of category N1, N2 or N3.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For investments in the following years, the rates are as follows:</p>

<li style=""text-align: justify;"">May not have received a claim for refund from the European Commission concerning aid granted by Belgium that is contrary to or incompatible with the internal market.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Carry forward of the investment deduction </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Investment deduction that cannot be used in a taxable period due to insufficient taxable base, can be transferred to the next taxable periods without limitation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Exception to this is the increased investment deduction of 25%.  This can only be transferred to the two following taxable periods for investments done until December 31, 2021 and to one following taxable period for investments done in the calendar year 2022. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that the deduction of the carried forward investment deduction together with the dividend deduction that can be carried forward unlimited in time, the transferred deduction for innovation income, the tax losses that can be carried forward unlimited in time and the notional interest deduction of the year is limited to EUR 1.000.000 + 70% of the difference between the balance that remains after the investment deduction and EUR 1.000.000. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion  </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The increased investment deduction of 25% for SMEs is certainly a good thing, but it should be weighed against the ordinary investment deductions that are provided for in view of the carry forward.  The new, albeit temporary, investment deduction for green trucks is also a good stimulus within the context of greening of the mobility in freight traffic.</p>

"New regulation for foreign employees, directors and researchers as from 1 January 2022",,,,https://www.crowe.com/be/spark/insights/buitenlandse-werknemers-bedrijfsleiders-onderzoekers
Relaxation for fee forms 281.50 on the way,23/12/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>In order to safeguard the deductibility of payments made to certain beneficiaries, companies and self-employed persons are required to report these payments on a form 281.50. These forms must be submitted annually by June 30th for payments made during the previous calendar year.</p>
<h2>Current regulation</h2>
<p>This obligation exists amongst others for the payment or granting of commissions, fees, brokerage fees, trade or other refunds, attendance fees, bonuses, (management) fees or benefits in kind which are taxable professional income for the recipients and which are not subject to the accounting obligations as included in the Code of Economic Law (amongst others the preparation of annual accounts) or for which no invoice has been issued.</p>
<p>Payments to foreign beneficiaries must in any case be mentioned on a form.</p>
<p>However, if the total amount per recipient per year is less than EUR 125.00, no form needs to be drawn up.</p>
<h2>Announced relaxation</h2>
<p>The regulation itself will not change. The obligation to draw up forms 281.50 will remain in full force.</p>
<p>It will only be abolished for payments following the supply of goods or services within the European Economic Area (EU, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein) and where such transactions are subject to a legal or regulatory obligation to issue an ""invoice or a document in lieu"". </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is left to the King to set a ceiling below which no forms must be drawn up. However, this ceiling may not exceed EUR 1.000 per year per recipient. </p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The changes would come into effect for payments made from 1 January 2021 and therefore already apply to the forms that must be submitted before 30 June 2022. The draft bill still needs to be approved. </p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>The relaxation for foreign beneficiaries is likely to lead to a reduction in administrative obligations for some taxpayers. For the ceiling, we still have to wait.</p>

Partial professional withholding tax exemption for R&D: a correct notification is important,23/06/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">Partial professional withholding tax exemption for R&amp;D: a correct notification is important</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Belgian tax law provides for various incentives in order to support companies with their research &amp; development activities / investments. One of these tax incentives – which is often applied - is the so-called partial professional withholding tax exemption for R&amp;D (hereinafter also referred to as the “R&amp;D WHT exemption”).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Various conditions and (notification) formalities have to be respected in order to be able to benefit from the R&amp;D WHT exemption. Non or incorrect / incomplete compliance with the (notification) formalities may, upon a tax audit, jeopardize the application of the regime. This has been confirmed by the Court of Hasselt recently again. </span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Please find hereinafter a high level and simplified overview of this regime.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">General principle</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Belgian tax law provides (subject to conditions) for a R&amp;D WHT exemption for (amongst others) universities, colleges, recognized scientific institutions, companies which pay remunerations to researchers working on R&amp;D projects in accordance with a cooperation agreement with the aforementioned institutions, as well as for companies that qualify as a so-called “Young Innovative Company” and which pay remunerations to certain scientific personnel employed by this company.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">A Young Innovative Company is a company which executes research projects and, at the end of the taxable period,</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: black;"">qualifies as a small company (as specifically determined for this incentive);</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span>exists for less than 10 years before 1 January of the year in which the R&amp;D WHT exemptionis granted;</li>
<li>was not incorporated in the context of a concentration, restructuring, expansion of a previous activity or a takeover of such activities;</li>
<li>has incurred R&amp;D expenditures representing at least 15% of the total costs of the previous taxable period.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">If, at the end of the taxable period, the company no longer fulfills the conditions to qualify as a <em>Young Innovative Company</em>, the R&amp;D WHT exemption can no longer be applied to the salaries paid / awarded from the following month. </span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Next to the above-mentioned institutions / entities, the R&amp;D WHT exemption may (subject to conditions) also be claimed by companies which pay or grant remunerations to employees (“researchers”) employed by such companies in R&amp;D projects or programs (i.e. projects or programs aimed at fundamental or industrial research or experimental development – these concepts are further defined in Belgian tax law) provided that the employees have one of the required diplomas.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">Amount of the R&amp;D WHT exemption</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">The R&amp;D WHT exemption is capped at max 80% of the professional withholding tax due on the salary of the qualifying researcher and has to be determined in function of the actual time spent on R&amp;D (i.e. <em>pro rata temporis</em>). Underling documentation has to be prepared / available in order to support this (e.g. via time sheets).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Since 2020, the R&amp;D WHT exemption of max 80% is also applicable to qualifying bachelors (which was capped at 40% before). The total amount of R&amp;D WHT exemption for qualifying bachelors may, however, not exceed 25% of the total amount of the exemption claimed for employees with a specific master or PhD. Said 25% threshold is doubled to 50% for small companies.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">BELSPO notification</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">The above-mentioned projects or programs have – prior to the application of the R&amp;D WHT exemption – to be notified to BELSPO. A specific registration tool has been made available in this respect. Important to note is that Belgian tax law stipulates that – amongst others - the following elements have to be reported:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: black;"">the identification of the debtor of the professional withholding tax;</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span>a description of the project or program indicating the fundamental or industrial research or experimental development nature/aim;</li>
<li>the expected start and anticipated end date of the project or program.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">BELSPO’s binding opinion regarding the qualification of the notified projects or programs can be requested in order to avoid future discussions.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">Expected start and end date</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">As indicated above, BELSPO has to be notified prior to the application of the R&amp;D WHT exemption whereby (amongst others) the expected start and anticipated end date of the project or program has to be mentioned. In practice, it is, however, often difficult to estimate the anticipated end date. Consequently, some companies do not report an anticipated end date in their notification. However, not mentioning an anticipated end date may, upon a tax audit, jeopardize the application of the R&amp;D WHT exemption (and, hence, the tax authorities may claim that the professional WHT due still has to be paid).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Useful reference can be made to a Parliamentary Question of 2020 to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance whereby the Minister referred in his reply to the legal requirements with regard to the aforementioned notification (including the fact that tax law provides that the expected start date and the anticipated end date of the project or program has to be reported in order to be able to claim the R&amp;D WHT exemption). </span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">Although the Minister acknowledges that the expected / anticipated start and end date of the project or program may differ from the actual start and end date, the Minister stipulates that the expected / anticipated (reported) start and end date must be realistic. A notification that does not include an end date or that does not include a realistic, but a purely hypothetical end date does not meet the legal conditions regarding the notification requirement (and, hence, there is no legitimate basis to claim the R&amp;D WHT exemption).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">The fact that reporting an expected / anticipated start and end date is an essential condition for the possible application of the R&amp;D WHT exemption was recently confirmed by the Court of Hasselt as well.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: black;"">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">If you are currently applying the R&amp;D WHT exemption, it is highly advisable to verify (amongst others) the correct application of the notification requirement. Upon request we can explain this in more detail.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">If you are not (yet) applying the R&amp;D WHT exemption and you are performing research and development activities, do not hesitate to contact us so we can discuss the potential application of this regime (and/or any other potential tax incentive) in more detail.</span></p>

Some fiscal points of attention at the year-end closing,23/12/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>With the end of the year in sight, it is useful to consider a number of measures that could have an impact on the tax position of companies.</p>
<p>Below we list a number of tax points of attention.</p>
<h2>Mobilization of reserves</h2>
<p>For tax years 2021 and 2022 (financial years 2020 and 2021), the possibility has been foreseen to transfer certain old tax-free reserves to the taxed reserves and to have them taxed at a favourable rate of 15% or 10% if certain investments were made during the financial year.</p>
<p>Tax year 2022 is therefore the last time that this favourable regime can be used. However keep in mind that this transfer to the taxable reserves leads to effective tax. The taxable base cannot be offset with any deductions, nor can any imputations be done.</p>
<h2>Reconstruction reserve</h2>
<p>In order to absorb the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the equity of companies and to restore their solvency, the reconstruction reserve was introduced as one of the measures to give companies more financial breathing space. </p>
<p>The reconstruction reserve offers companies the possibility, under certain conditions, to create an exempt reserve in tax years 2022, 2023 and/or 2024 up to the amount of the accounting loss they incurred in the financial year ending in 2020 (in some cases, for the financial year ending in 2021) with an absolute maximum of 20 million euros. For each taxable period, however, the creation is limited to the taxable reserved profit before creation of the construction reserve.</p>
<p>Tax year 2022 is the first year in which the reconstruction reserve can be built up. Maintaining the exemption requires that no distributions are made from equity and that the employment level is maintained at the same level. </p>

Tax-friendly remuneration: the corona premium,05/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>In the context of the wage agreement in which a maximum wage increase of 0.4% above the obligatory indexation was agreed, it was further decided that this may still be supplemented with a 'corona premium'.</p>
<h2>The corona premium for employees</h2>
<p>The corona premium can be granted by employers to their employees from 1 August 2021 to 31 December 2021. This will be paid in the form of cheques. The cheques will be valid until December 31, 2022. </p>
<p>The granting must be contained in a collective labour agreement concluded at sectoral or company level.  In the absence of a trade union delegation, the granting may also be done in a written individual agreement. The maximum amount that can be granted is EUR 500,00.  It can be spent in the catering, sports and cultural sector as well as in retail stores that have been closed for at least a month.</p>
<p>For social security purposes, the corona premium is not regarded as salary, so that no ordinary social security contributions are due (neither employer nor employee contributions). There is only a special employer's contribution of 16.5%.</p>
<p>For tax purposes, the premium as well as the special employer's contribution can be deducted as professional expense for employers. For employees, it is an exempt social benefit. Therefore, no tax is due. </p>
<h2>The corona premium for self-employed persons </h2>
<p>Self-employed persons can also qualify for a premium if they have received a ‘bridging right’ for 6 months in the period from 1 October 2020 to 30 April 2021. The gross amount is EUR 598,80 and is paid in cash. It can be spent wherever the individual wants. The premium is taxable separately at 16.5%, so that it amounts to EUR 500,00 net. Both companies’ directors as other self-employed persons as well as coworking spouses can benefit from the premium.  Self-employed persons in a secondary occupation are also eligible, provided that the social contributions they pay are as high as those of a self-employed person in main occupation. The premium was automatically paid by the social security funds on 30 September 2021 at the latest, but does not accrue social rights.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The corona premium gives employers an additional opportunity to provide their employees with an extra remuneration in a tax-friendly manner. </p>

Deduction limitations of recharged costs: an update,05/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>A number of costs, although professional, are only partly or even not at all tax deductible: e.g. costs of cars (percentage depending among others on CO2), restaurant (69%), reception and business gifts (50%), clothing (not deductible). If these costs are passed on, there is a risk of double taxation: on the one hand to the party who bears the costs in the first place and on the other hand to its customer.</p>
<p>We look first at the current arrangements and then at the legislative proposal.</p>
<h2>Recharged car expenses</h2>
<p>Article 66, §2, paragraph 4 WIB1992 confirms that for car expenses no deduction limitation applies for costs recharged to third parties, provided that these costs are explicitly and separately mentioned on the invoice. The tax deduction limitation of the (recharged) car expenses does not apply to the taxpayer who incurred the expense and recharges it, but to the third party to whom the expenses are recharged. </p>
<p>However, there are conditions for the deduction restriction not to be applied to the person who recharges:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be car costs that are recharged to third parties for the same amount and by means of an explicit and separate statement on the invoice;</li>
<li>The CO2 emissions and fuel used must be included in the invoice, so that the third party to whom the car costs are re-invoiced is able to apply the correct tax deduction limitation with respect to the costs (recharged) to him.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recharged restaurant and reception costs </h2>
<p>Here the Administration accepts that the deduction limitation must not be applied to costs recharged to ""a third party who is also subject to the deduction limitation and in a manner that leaves no doubt as to the precise scope of the transaction."" Unlike the legal regulation of recharged car expenses, restaurant and reception expenses do require that the third party be taxable in Belgium.</p>
<h2>Legislative proposal on recharged costs </h2>
<p>It is proposed to apply the same rules to recharged restaurant, reception, business gifts, clothing, hunting and fishing expenses as those for recharged car expenses. The deduction limitation will then no longer apply if the costs are recharged to third parties, provided that these costs are explicitly and separately stated on the invoice.</p>
<h2>Legislative proposal on the price of trade goods </h2>
<p>It is also proposed to expressly provide that the price of trade goods (within the meaning of the accounting legislation) is a professional expense that is not subject to the deduction restrictions. We are thinking here of expenses booked in a 60 account. If the costs are entered in the accounts as trade goods in accordance with the accounting legislation, the deduction limitation would therefore not apply and there is also no need to mention these goods separately on the invoice.</p>
<p>This rule is particularly relevant for event organizers, but its scope can be much broader.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This bill, which would apply as of tax year 2022, would allow the deduction limits to no longer be applied to the service provider in a number of cases. We will keep you posted on the further evolution. </p>
<p> </p>

Wage tax exemption in ‘support zones’ extended,01/07/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>Companies that invest in a demarcated ‘support zone’ can obtain an exemption of 25% of wage tax during a period of 2 years per additional job created as a result of this investment provided the additional employment is maintained at the same level during 3 years for SME’s and 5 years for large companies. This means that the employer must withhold the tax from the employee’s salary but must not pay it to the state, thus generating a cash benefit for the employer.</p>
<h2>Support zones</h2>
<p>Governments may take support measures to areas affected by massive collective redundancies. Flanders has currently demarcated three zones: around Genk, Turnhout and Zaventem-Vilvoorde. In the Walloon region there are four zones: around Seraing, Sambreville, Charleroi and Frameries.</p>
<p>The support period for the Flemish zones around Genk and Turnhout has now been extended until October 31, 2022 and the one around Zaventem-Vilvoorde until May 31, 2026. The Walloon zones have been extended until April 30, 2025.</p>
<h2>Size of the company</h2>
<p>To verify whether a company can benefit from the exemption, it must first be assessed whether the company is a SME company or a large company. </p>
<p>A SME company is a company that does not exceed more than one of the following criteria, the case being on a consolidated basis, in at least two out of the three last closed taxable periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annual average workforce: 250 employees</li>
<li>Annual turnover excluding VAT: 50 million euros</li>
<li>Balance sheet total: 43 million euros</li>
</ul>
<p>SME companies can benefit from the measure in the entire zone while large companies can only benefit from it within a limited area in each zone. This can be verified on www.geopunt.be for Flanders or on www.geoportail.wallonie.be for the Walloon region.</p>
<p>Some companies are excluded anyway for instance companies that are in a business continuity procedure or whose net assets have decreased below less than 50% of the fixed part of their equity, companies that are held for more than 25% by a government,….</p>
<h2>Additional conditions</h2>
<p>Companies are only eligible if they create additional jobs at an establishment located in the demarcated zone. There should also be a clear link between the investment and the location concerned on the one hand and the additional jobs and the location concerned on the other hand. This can be newly created jobs or the increase of jobs and this within 36 months after the completion of the investment. The additional jobs must be maintained at the same level during 3 years for SME companies and 5 years for large companies.</p>
<p>The employer must make qualifying investments. This can go from the incorporation of a new establishment, the expansion of the capacity of an existing establishment (not for large companies), the diversification of production, a fundamental change in the complete production process (not for large companies) or the take-over of material or immaterial assets from a non-associated employer following closure, bankruptcy or judicial reorganization.</p>
<h2>Formalities</h2>
<p>The exemption must be requested within 3 months after completion of the investment but before the start of the employment.</p>
<p>The employer can immediately benefit from the exemption during 2 years. The exemption is however only final after proof has been provided that the job created has been kept during 3 years for SME companies and 5 years for large companies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When starting or expanding an establishment, it is recommended to verify whether the employer can apply for the wage tax exemption in view of the significant cash benefit it generates, especially in the Flanders region where almost the entire region is demarcated as support zone.</p>

Changed reporting obligation regarding costs proper to the employer,05/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>Traditionally, costs proper to the employer are defined as costs incurred by an employee or company director in the course of their professional activity, but which are for the account of the employer. These costs are often 'advanced' by the employee or the director and subsequently reimbursed via 'expense reports'. However, for the sake of convenience, the lump sum allowances foreseen by the tax authorities and the social security authorities are often used.</p>
<p>In order not to jeopardize the (limited or unlimited) deductibility of these costs in the name of the employer and/or not to run the risk that these costs would be subject to the special assessment as secret commissions, employers better report both the lump sum reimbursed costs as the costs reimbursed on the basis of supporting documents on the individual pay slips 281.10 of the employees respectively 218.20 of the directors. </p>
<h2>Actual reporting obligation</h2>
<p>Currently, the following statements must be mentioned on the forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it concerns a lump sum reimbursement determined in accordance with serious standards: YES, serious standards</li>
<li>If it concerns a lump sum reimbursement that has not been determined in accordance with serious standards: the amount of the reimbursed costs</li>
<li>If it concerns a reimbursement that  has been determined on the basis of supporting documents: YES, supporting documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>If different types of expense allowances are granted, a combination of the different statements should be mentioned.</p>
<p>Future reporting obligation</p>
<p>As from January 1, 2022, for reimbursement of costs based on supporting documents, the amount must also be mentioned on the salary form. This must be done in the 'miscellaneous information' box.
Failure to do so will result in an administrative sanction. However, the non-deductibility of the costs is not jeopardized and the assessment as a secret commission is not immediately threatening.<br>
<em>Note that it was already provided that from that same date the actual amount paid as home-work allowances must also be included on the forms.</em></p>
<h2>Ratio legis</h2>
<p>The introduction of this stricter reporting obligation should allow the tax authorities to better verify cost reimbursements. On the one hand, they want to limit the double reimbursement of costs on the one hand on a lump sum basis and on the other hand on the basis of supporting documents. On the other hand, they want to avoid that that employees deduct certain costs as actual professional  xpenses while they already receive a lump sum allowance from their employer for the same costs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The additional reporting obligation once again increases the administrative burden on employers.</p>
And although this will only take effect for payments from January 1, 2022 and must therefore only be included in the forms that must be submitted before March 1, 2023, employers do well to already think now about a system to ensure that this reporting runs smoothly. It is also a good opportunity to take a critical look at the actual full package of cost reimbursements.

Until the 30th of June, every EU Member State has set a so-called ‘distance sale threshold’, ranging from 35.000 to 100.000 Euro (excl. VAT), or the equivalent in local currency. Once e-commerce traders exceed the distance sales threshold for a given Member State, their B2C distance sales of goods become VAT taxable in the Member State of arrival of the goods (instead of the Member State of departure) under the current rules, entailing local VAT registration and periodical compliance obligations in said Member State(s).<br>
<br>
As of the 1st of July 2021, these distance sales thresholds will be abolished (only a threshold of 10.000 Euro (excl. VAT) for micro-enterprises, with a very limited scope, will remain). Hence, the B2C intra-Community distance sales of goods will be principally VAT taxable in the Member State of arrival of the goods. In order to limit the VAT registration and compliance burden in the hands of e-commerce traders, it was decided to extend the Mini One Stop Shop, to all B2C services and to intra-Community distance sales of goods, making it a One Stop Shop (‘OSS’). As a result, it will be possible to report and pay VAT due on B2C services and intra-Community distance sales of goods in other Member States via a single OSS return in the Member State of identification. Businesses should investigate whether they can close their historic VAT registrations in other EU Member States due to the impact of these new rules.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Cancellation of the VAT exemption for low value imports</h2>
<p>
As of the 1st of July 2021, the VAT exemption for the import of consignments of a low value of up to EUR 22 will be abolished. As a result, VAT will principally become due on all importations of commercial goods into the EU. In order to facilitate trade, an import scheme (I-OSS) has been created covering distance sales of goods imported from third territories or third countries to customers in the EU up to a value of EUR 150.
<br>
As of the 1st of July 2021, when the import scheme (I-OSS) is used, the seller will charge and collect the VAT at the point of sale to EU customers and report and pay that VAT to the Member State of identification in the I-OSS (similar to the OSS return). These goods will then benefit from a VAT exemption upon importation, allowing for faster customs clearance.</p>
<h2>E-commerce platforms may be considered to be deemed suppliers</h2>
<p>
Businesses operating electronic interfaces such as online marketplaces or platforms will, in certain situations, be considered to be a intermediary supplier of the goods sold to customers in the EU (legal fiction). As a result, the marketplace or platform will in these situations be required to collect and pay the VAT on these sales.</p>

Belgian Summerplan,10/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">As you may have already heard, a number of relaxations will again take effect as of Wednesday 9th of June 2021.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;""> </p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">These relaxations are part of the first step in the ""Summer Plan"". </p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">We have listed the most important changes for you.</p>
<h2> Return to the workplace</h2>
<p>
Since the previous consultation committee, it has been permitted for employers to organize <strong>'return moments'</strong>. In concrete terms, these are moments when employees who have been doing <strong>compulsory telework</strong> in the past few months can come back to the office. Note that teleworking is still compulsory until the <strong>1<sup>st</sup> of July 2021</strong>.</p>
<p>
These return moments do have a number of mandatory conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>These moments are allowed for a maximum of 20% of the employees at the same time and for one day a week.
</li>
<li> In companies with less than 10 employees, a maximum of 5 employees may be present at the same time. However, testing of employees is strongly recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>
Employees returning from holidays abroad </h2>
<p>The rules below only apply as of the 1st of July 2021. Until that date, the current measures remain in force. </p>
<p>Employees can travel freely within the European Union if they have a <strong>digital corona certificate</strong>. 
This certificate is proof that someone has been vaccinated against corona, has tested negative, or has recently recovered from corona. <strong>The Passenger Location Form</strong> (PLF) is still compulsory, but the distinction between private and business travel has been removed. Therefore, it is no longer mandatory for business trips to complete the Business Travel Brad tool, but the PLF must be completed.</p>
<p>The quarantine rules regarding travel will also be adjusted:</p>
<ul>
<li>When your employees return from a green or orange zone, they are not required to go into quarantine or be tested. </li>
<li>When your employees return from a red zone, they do not have to go into quarantine after returning, provided they have a digital corona certificate or a recent PCR test.
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Foreign Workers</h2>
<p>If, as an employer, you employ foreign workers, the same rules apply. However, other rules apply if your employees come from countries that are not members of the European Union:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign employees who come from outside the European Union must be fully vaccinated (+ 2 weeks) with a vaccine recognized by Europe and take a PCR test on the day of arrival. If the test is negative, this employee does not have to go into quarantine.</li>
<li>An entry ban applies to foreign employees who come from or have stayed in a very high-risk area (""Variants of concern""). Exceptions are made for essential travel by transport personnel and diplomats. They must undergo a 10-day mandatory quarantine with a PCR test on day 1 and day 7. The quarantine may only be interrupted for an essential reason.
</li>
</ul>

Modification of the VAT exemption for medical care,08/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>Medical care is in principle exempt from VAT in the European Union. To this end, an VAT exemption was implemented at the European level for services provided by (para)medical professionals and medical care (as well as closely related supplies of goods and services) provided by hospitals. </p>
<p>In its case law, the Court of Justice of the European Union has consistenly ruled that only services which have a therapeutic aim can be exempted on the basis of the aforementioned VAT exemption. Whether or not a service has a therapeutic aim must be assessed by reference to both the factual and the legal context in which the service is performed.</p>
<p>In the Belgian VAT legislation and administrative guidelines, the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care is currently linked to the capacity of the service provider (qualified care providers, accredited care institutions, etc.) and the type of services (services included in the nomenclature of medical services). </p>
<p>The therapeutic or non-therapeutic aim of a services is currently not the essential criterion in Belgian VAT legislation and administrative guidelines for exempting (or not) a (para)medical service from VAT. Today, for example, medical services of an aesthetic nature are already excluded from the VAT exemptions for medical care, but many other non-therapeutic services performed by (para)medical professionals and the medical institutions are still exempt from VAT.<br>
In addition, certain healthcare providers, e.g. chiropractors and osteopaths, were principally excluded from the VAT exemption for medical care due to the fact that they belong to a non-regulated profession. </p>
<p>Compared to the European legislation and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Belgian legislator and VAT administration apply the VAT exemption for medical care too strictly and too broadly at the same time. Following the Belgian Constitutional Court's ruling No. 194/2019 of December 5, 2019, a thorough review of Belgian VAT legislation and administrative guidelines in this regard was necessary. </p>
<h2>Modification of VAT exemption for medical care as from January 1, 2022</h2>
<p>In order to bring Belgian practice regarding the VAT exemption for medical care in line with European legislation as well as the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Belgian Constitutional Court, the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care in Belgium is being revised. The changes will take effect from January 1, 2022.</p>
<p>From now on, the VAT exemption for medical care will be limited to services relating to interventions and treatments with a therapeutic aim. This means that non-therapeutic treatments will principally no longer be able to benefit from the VAT exemption for medical care. </p>
<p>In addition, the services of non-regulated (para)medical professions can also benefit from the VAT exemption – provided their qualifications are recognized by the VAT administration. More specifically, as from 1 January 2022, the VAT exemption can be claimed by, on the one hand, (para)medical care providers with a degree issued by a recognized educational institution and, on the other hand, by persons who possess the necessary qualifications to provide medical care of a sufficiently high level of quality to be comparable to the medical care provided by the aforementioned qualified (para)medical care providers, for example chiropractors and osteopaths. It goes without saying that (para)medical care can only be VAT exempt if a therapeutic aim is present.</p>
<p>Finally, incidental supplies of goods and services by healthcare institutions, the so-called ""supplies closely related to hospital care"" transactions, will only be exempt from VAT as of January 1, 2022, provided that (i) they are indispensable for the provision of the exempted medical care, or (ii) they are not primarily intended to provide the institution with additional revenue through the performance of transactions carried out in direct competition with transactions of commercial enterprises subject to VAT. These conditions are not cumulative. The establishment of one of the aforementioned circumstances is sufficient to exclude the application of the VAT exemption.Wat is de impact voor de medische sector?</p>
<h2>What is the impact for the medical sector?</h2>
<p>Although the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care is both broadened and limited by the aforementioned legislative amendment, in our opinion the main impact of the amendment will be felt on the side of the limitation of the VAT exemption.</p>
<p>Today, the Belgian administrative guidelines allow a great many services (and supplies of goods) without a therapeutic aim to fall within the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care. These include the existing directives and tolerances regarding the provision of televisions and telephones to patients, the operation of drinking and eating establishments by healthcare institutions, the operation of hospital car parks, hairdressing or manicuring services for patients, etc. </p>
<p>Will the change in the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care revolutionize medical services? On a first reading of the legislative documents, the upcoming amendment indeed seems to hold a major change. However, the practical implementation of the legislative change by the VAT administration will have to provide more clarity. The Belgian VAT administration has indicated that it will publish new administrative guidelines, in principle before the new legislation enters into force on January 1, 2022.</p>

Foreign real estate gets a cadastral income,30/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>You will remember the heated discussion that dragged on for several years. Belgian real estate belonging to natural persons that is not rented out or rented out for private purposes is taxed on the basis of the cadastral income (CI). Foreign real estate was taxed on the rental value or the rent received. In practice, depending on the country, all kinds of formulas appeared to determine this 'rental value'.</p>
<p>After being repeatedly condemned by Europe for this, Belgium has now (finally) amended its legislation (Law of 17 February 2021, Belgian Official Gazette of 25 February 2021).</p>
<h2>Attribution of a cadastral income</h2>
<p>From now on, all real estate located abroad will be assigned a CI and taxation will arise according to the same rules as for real estate located in Belgium. However, if the immovable property is located in a country with which Belgium has concluded a double tax treaty, the income thus determined remains (usually) exempt with progression. This means that it is only taken into account for determining the tax rate on the other income to be taxed in Belgium. For countries without a treaty, the tax is reduced to 50%.</p>
<p>The taxable base for non-rented or privately rented immovable property is then the indexed CI x 1,4. Where in the old scheme foreign tax could be deducted, this is no longer possible in the new scheme.</p>
<p>The latter also applies to other real estate (for instance rented to a company) that remains taxable on the basis of the net rent. This is the gross amount of rent received and the rental benefits less 10% lump sum expenses for land and 40% for built immovable property. However, this deduction is limited to 2/3 of the non-indexed CI x a revalorization coefficient. The consequence here is that the foreign tax is no longer deductible since it is deemed to be included in the lump sum expenses.</p>
<p>Another consequence is that a possible requalification of rent in remuneration for company directors is now also possible for foreign real estate.</p>
<h2>Determination of the cadastral income</h2>
<p>The CI is determined in the same way as the CI for Belgian immovable property i.e. on the basis of the normal net rental value on January 1, 1975.<br>
In practice, this is done as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For land: EUR 2,00 per hectare.</li>
<li>For buildings: by applying 5,3% on:
<ul>
<li>the normal sales value at the reference time (1 January 1975) or</li>
<li>if it is no longer possible to determine the normal sales value on 1 January 1975, the current normal sales value to which subsequently a correction factor is applied, which is determined per year. The correction factor is 15,018 for 2021 and 15,036 for 2020. The previous years can be found in Circular 2021/C/21 of 1 March 2021.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The normal sales value is then the sales value that can be obtained under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, a property purchased in 2021 with a current normal sales value of EUR 400.000 will have a CI of EUR 1.412 = 400.000 : 15,018 x 5,3%.</p>
<h2>Procedure and information to be provided</h2>
<p>If an immovable property is acquired as from 1 January 2021, this must be reported spontaneously to the authorities within 4 months of the acquisition. For goods acquired before that date, this must be done before 31 December 2021.</p>
<p>The declaration can be submitted via MyMinfin. The form can also be requested by e-mail on the following e-mail address: foreigncad@minfin.fed.be or by letter to the Administration of Measurements and Valuations , Cel Foreign Cadastral Income , Koning Albert II laan 33 box 55, 1030 Brussels. Taxpayers who had already declared foreign real estate income in their tax return in the past, in principle receive the form directly from the tax authorities.</p>
<p>The following information must, among other things, be included: type (villa, apartment), location, share of ownership, current sales value or price paid and year of purchase as well as any costs of construction or renovation works and the year they were completed. After the CI has been determined, this will be communicated by registered letter. An objection can then be lodged within 2 months.</p>
<p>Attention: not only the purchase, but also the sale, succession, rebuilding or any other change in your rights in rem of the foreign real estate, must be reported spontaneously.</p>
<h2>Sanction</h2>
<p>Taxpayers who fail to make the necessary notifications face a fine of EUR 250 to EUR 3.000.</p>
<h2>As from when does this apply?</h2>
<p>The newly determined CI will be taken into account in the personal income tax return as from tax year 2022 (income from 2021). For tax year 2021 (income from 2020), everything remains the same as now.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that the discrimination between Belgian and foreign real estate has been eliminated with the new regulation. Whether this will be in the taxpayer's advantage or disadvantage, however, remains to be seen.</p>

When it is mandatory to appoint a statutory auditor?,13/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span>Everyone knows the criteria for determining whether or not a company is 'large' and therefore, in principle, must appoint a statutory auditor.  But what if a company is part of a group that must or must not consolidate? And what if the company is part of an international group?<br>
What follows is a short summary.<br>
</span></p>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Stand-alone companies   </span></h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>A company is considered to be large and must therefore appoint a statutory auditor if more than one of the following three criteria is exceeded:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual average workforce: 50 employees</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual turnover excluding VAT: 9,000,000 euros</span></li>

</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>If more than one of these three criteria is exceeded or no longer exceeded, this only has consequences if this occurs in two consecutive financial years. The consequences will then take effect from the following financial year. </span>Suppose: a company exceeds more than one of the three criteria for the financial years 2019  and 2020, then it will be considered large as from the financial year 2021 and must appoint a statutory auditor.</p>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Companies that are part of a Belgian group that is required to consolidate</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When a company is part of a group of companies that are obliged to consolidate, a statutory auditor must be appointed even if the company concerned is considered small in itself. </span>In Belgium, the consolidation obligation exists for any company that alone or jointly controls one or more subsidiaries or forms a consortium, except:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company itself is a subsidiary.</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company is a parent company that only has subsidiaries of negligible significance.</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company is part of a group of ‘limited’ size.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>A group of ‘’limited’ size is then a group that on a consolidated basis does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual average workforce: 250 employees</span></li>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>These criteria must be verified on the closing date of the consolidating company's financial year. I</span>f more than one of these three criteria is exceeded or no longer exceeded, this only has consequences if this occurs in two consecutive financial years. The consequences will then take effect from the following financial year.</p>

<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Companies that are part of an international group that is required to consolidate</span></h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Also when a company is part of an international group of companies that is obliged to consolidate, a statutory auditor must be appointed. In this regard, consideration should be given to the rules on consolidation obligations that apply abroad, which may be stricter than the Belgian ones, so that, the case being, consolidation must be carried out more quickly there than in Belgium.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>It is therefore possible that a small Belgian company has to appoint a statutory auditor because of a consolidation obligation abroad.</span></p>

Increased ordinary one-off investment deduction,30/05/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">The investment deduction of 25% already knew many changes since its start. Following Corona further adjustments have been made.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">If certain conditions are met, this deduction allows a part of the profit to be exempt up to a certain percentage of the acquisition or investment value of new tangible and intangible fixed assets that are used in Belgium for the exercise of a professional activity. </p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">For which companies?</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Only SME companies can apply the ordinary one-off investment deduction. These are companies that are classified as a small company in accordance with the Company Code.  A company is small if it does not exceed more than one of the following criteria for the last closed financial year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annual average of the personnel: 50 employees</li>
<li>Annual turnover VAT excluded: 9.000.000 euro</li>
<li>Balance sheet total: 4.500.000 euro</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">If more than one of the criteria are exceeded or are no longer exceeded, this only has consequences if this occurs in two consecutive financial years. The consequences will then take effect from the following financial year.<br>
In case of affiliated companies, the criteria for turnover and balance sheet must be calculated on a consolidated basis.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">The company must then be small in the year of the investment, this is in the financial year in which the investments become depreciable.</p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Percentage</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><em>The base percentage is 8%.  </em></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">For investments done between January 1st 2018 and December 31st 2019, this percentage was temporarily increased to 20%. From January  1st 2020, the base rate of 8% would then apply again. However, following the Covid pandemic, it was again temporarily increased, this time to 25% and this for investments made from March 12th 2020 to December 31st 2020.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">The latter measure was then further extended for qualifying investments until December 31st 2022.<br>
<strong>Attention</strong>: the investments are linked to the calendar year and not to the financial year!</p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><em>Example</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>New qualifying investment of 80.000 euro in 2021 </em></li>
<li><em>Investment deduction = 20.000 euro (80.000 x 25 %) </em></li>
<li><em>This provides SMEs whose first 100.000 euros are taxed at the reduced rate of 20% a tax saving of 4.000 euros. </em> </li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Some points of attention</h3>
<ul>
<li>This investment deduction cannot be combined with the notional interest deduction.</li>
<li>If the deduction cannot be used because there isn’t (enough) profit, the unused portion of the investment deduction is transferable for one year. However, the unused investment deduction for investments made in 2019 is transferable for two years.</li>
<li>The existing increased deductions for among others investments in patents, environmentally friendly investments in R&amp;D, smoke extraction or ventilation systems in the catering industry and digital investments (13.5%) as well as those in the securing of professional premises and commercial vehicles (20.5%) will be out of play as these are lower than the now generally increased deduction of 25%.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Conclusion</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">The extension is good news for SMEs. You still have until the end of next year to make investments that qualify for the increased deduction.</p>

The exempt reconstruction reserve,28/05/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">In order to absorb the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the equity of companies and to restore their solvency, the reconstruction reserve was announced in the spring of 2020 as one of the measures to give companies more financial breathing space. Ultimately, the reserve was approved by the law of November 19, 2020, which introduced a new article 194quater/1 in the 1992 CIR</p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">The reconstruction reserve offers companies the option, under certain conditions, to create an exempt reserve in the assessment years 2022, 2023 and / or 2024 up to the amount of the loss they incurred in the financial year ending in 2020 (in some cases, for the financial year that closes in 2021) with an absolute maximum of 20 million euros.</p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Which losses?</h3>
<p>The reconstruction reserve is created on the basis of the business operating loss that was incurred in the financial year closed in 2020. There does not need to be a tax loss. It is irrelevant whether or not the losses were incurred as a result of the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>Companies whose financial year closes between January 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020, have the choice to take into account the loss of the financial year closed in 2020 or that of the financial year closed in 2021.</p>
<h3>Creation of the reserve</h3>
<p>The reconstruction reserve is created per taxable period associated with the assessment years 2022, 2023 and/or 2024 to the amount of the taxable reserved profit before the reconstruction reserve is created.</p>
<p><em>Example: a company has an accounting loss of EUR 100.000 as at 31 December 2020. As from assessment year 2022 up to and including assessment year 2024, it can create a reconstruction reserve of a maximum of EUR 100,000 in function of its taxable reserved profit before the reconstruction reserve for the financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023.</em></p>
<p>The created reserve must further meet the ""intangibility condition"" and must be booked in one or more separate accounts on the liabilities’ side of the annual accounts.</p>
<h3>Retention and reversal of the exemption</h3>
<p>However, the created reconstruction reserve becomes taxable to the extent that the company makes distributions from its equity or when its employment level falls, and this at any time after the reconstruction reserve has been created. At the latest at the time of the liquidation of the company, the part of the reconstruction reserve that has not yet been taxed becomes taxable.</p>
<h3>Equity distributions</h3>
<div>Any distribution or allotment since the creation of the reconstruction reserve up to the liquidation of the company gives rise to a taxable reversal of the established reserve. More specifically, it concerns the following transactions:</div>
<ul>
<li>Repurchase of own shares: reversal up to the value of the shares repurchased at the time of repurchase;</li>
<li>Allocation or distribution of dividends: reversal of the amount of the allocated or distributed dividend;</li>
<li>Capital decrease (including the repayment of locked-in reserves) or ""any other decrease"" in equity: reversal of the amount of the decrease; here ""any other reduction"" is broadly interpreted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decline in employment level</h3>
<p>
The personnel costs in the 62 account must be maintained at at least 85% of the amount in that account for the financial year that ended in 2019. If this is not the case, the difference between that 85% and the amount of the financial year concerned becomes taxable. The latter amount then becomes the new threshold value for the following fiscal years. The ""remuneration test"" must be done every year.<br>
<br>
The taxable part of the reconstruction reserve can be offset against all tax deductions that the company would have at its disposal.</p>
<h3>Which companies?</h3>
<p>
In principle, ALL companies that are subject to corporate tax or non-resident corporate tax are eligible. The measure is therefore not limited to SMEs. Obviously, the company must have incurred a loss in the ""Covid year"".<br>
However, the following companies are excluded in any case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies that were already in difficulties on March 18, 2020 (including companies in liquidation);</li>
<li>Companies that, in the period from March 12, 2020 up to the date of submission of their corporate income tax return in which the reserve is set up, have repurchased own shares, paid dividends, have implemented a capital reduction or have conducted any other reduction in capital or equity;</li>
<li>Investment companies, regulated real estate companies, cooperative private equity firms and shipping companies subject to tonnage tax;</li>
<li>Companies that have a direct participation in a company in a tax haven or that make payments to such companies of at least EUR 100,000 unless these payments meet legitimate financial or economic needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concurrence with other favourable tax measures</h3>
<p>
The reconstruction reserve does not affect the tax losses incurred in the Covid year. It is not because these have (partly) been the subject of the reconstruction reserve that they are no longer tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reserve can be created together with the application of the carry-back system of losses or with the system of fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it has a negative impact on the amount of the taxable retained profit, which means that it can influence the interest deduction limitation or the tax shelter for audio-visual works or stage productions as these are based / limited in function of the amount of the taxable retained profit..</p>
<h3>Other formalities</h3>
<p>
For the tax years in which the exemption is applied, the company must add a form to its tax return that will be determined.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The introduction of the Reconstruction Reserve offers help to companies that have suffered business losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic and can provide financial breathing room.<br>
However, there are many conditions attached to this and the remuneration test requires that it must be followed up annually..</p>

New guidelines for home work allowances,25/05/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Due to the corona pandemic, many employees now work from home in a more ""structural"" way and this trend is likely to continue post-corona. That is why the administration has issued new guidelines in its Circular 2021/C/20 on the allowances that can be granted tax-free to employees in the context of working from home.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span>Know that also the social security authorities use the same amounts.</span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">For who? </h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The new rules apply to <strong>employees</strong> and <strong>civil servants</strong>, NOT company directors. Also employees who fall under special regimes, eg foreign executives benefitting from the special tax regime for expatriates, employees who work with a salary split,…. are excluded.<br>
For the latter categories, allowances can be granted on the basis of justifying documents or on the basis of serious and consistent standards for which a prior decision can be obtained from the Service for Anticipated Decisions.  </span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>What is meant by home work?</span></h3>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Home work is defined as ""any form of organization and / or performance of the work in which activities that could also be performed on the work floor of the employer are carried out on a regular basis outside that work floor"". The work floor also includes the activities that are normally carried out at the customer or at another location (eg in a satellite office of the employer). Outside the workplace then means in the <strong>private premises of the employee</strong>.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Furthermore, this homework must be <strong>structural and regular</strong>. This means that the equivalent of one working day per week (eg one full working day per week, two half working days per week, several days of a few hours performed during normal working hours) is worked from home. This is then assessed on a monthly basis. Please note: homework must be performed during normal working hours, so not in the evenings or during the weekend.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; padding: 0cm; border: none;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Non-structural homeworkers are, for example, employees who only work from home for a few hours a month, who perform their normal working hours on the work floor or elsewhere but then, for example, still do administration at home in the evening or further those who are absent for a full month, for example due to illness , vacation, maternity leave, technical unemployment, ...</span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Which allowances?</h3>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>On the one hand, it concerns the <strong>reimbursement</strong> of the following costs borne by the employee:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;""><span>Office costs</span></li>
<li style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;""><span>Costs of office furniture / IT equipment</span></li>

</ul>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">On the other hand, it concerns the <strong>putting at the disposal of</strong> the employee by the employer  of office furniture / IT equipment.</span></p>
<h4 style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 36pt;""><strong><em><span>Reimbursement of costs</span></em></strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>The lump sum office allowance covers all office costs and amounts to EUR 129,48 per month. For the months of April, May and June 2021, this amount is increased to EUR 144,31 per month. In the case of part-time work, these amounts do not have to be reduced proportionally as long as the above conditions regarding structural work from home are met (one working day per week on a monthly basis).</span></p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>This allowance covers all costs associated with the office, such as the use of an office space at the employee’s home, printer and computer materials such as paper, USB stick, mouse pad, ink (not the PC and printer itself), office supplies such as folders, course blocks, ball pens. ,…, utilities, maintenance, insurance, property tax and coffee, water, refreshments.</span></p>

<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>In addition, the reimbursement of, among other things, <em>an office chair, table or cupboard and / or lamp, second screen, printer / scanner, keyboard, headphones</em>,…. Is possible if the employer also makes this type of material available on the work floor.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>However, reimbursement is only possible on the basis of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">supporting documents</span> and insofar as the investments by the employee are <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">strictly necessary</span> to carry out the professional activity at home in a normal manner.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>Reimbursement is possible in one time or in instalments according to the normal useful life of the investment. The following normal useful life is assumed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 36pt;""><span>Office chair, table or cupboard: 10 years</span></li>

</ul>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>In case of a one-time reimbursement, the residual value of the investment will be taxed as a taxable benefit in the name of the employee if he leaves the employer before the end of the investment's useful life and he does not need to repay the residual value to the employer. Taxation as benefit in kind also applies to investments that exceed professional needs.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><strong><span>Costs for professional use of a private internet connection and subscription</span></strong></p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><strong><em><span></span></em></strong>A lump sum allowance of <strong>EUR 20,00</strong> per month can be granted.   </p>

<h4 style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><strong><em><span>Putting at the disposal of material by the employer</span></em></strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>The lump sum allowance can be combined with the putting at the disposal by the employer of office furniture or IT equipment, insofar as he also makes this available in the workplace under normal circumstances. If the employee is allowed to keep the equipment after termination of the home work or employment contract, the fair value does constitute a taxable benefit in kind.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>If the putting at the disposal relates to a PC, laptop, internet connection, mobile telephone and fixed or mobile telephone subscription that are also used privately, a fixed benefit in kind will be charged for this.</span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Additional reporting obligations? </h3>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">As from the income year 2022, in addition to the usual statements regarding costs proper to the employer, the amount of the allowances must also be included on the forms 281.10 of the employees.</p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Entry into force </h3>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;"">This new regulation has entered into force on March 1, 2021, but the administration will already take it into account for situations of home work as from January 1, 2021. </p>

<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In summary, it can be stated that the lump sum allowances can be paid together with the reimbursement or putting at the disposal of office equipment as long as they do not cover the same costs. </span></p>

New rules concerning ‘company car taxation’,05/05/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span>The new rules regarding the taxation of company cars, a consequence of the ‘summer agreement’, have meanwhile entered into force. We hereby give you an overview of the new corporate tax rules.</span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Deduction of car costs</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Until 2020, the deduction was determined based on the CO2 emission of the car. This resulted in a deduction between 120% for electric cars and 50% for cars with emissions of more than 195 grams. Fuel costs were deductible for 75%.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>As from 2020 (or more correctly: from assessment year 2021 for taxable periods starting from January 1<sup>st</sup>  2020) the percentage of deduction is calculated according to the formula:</span></p>
<div style=""padding: 1pt 4pt; border-width: 1pt; border-style: solid; border-image: initial;"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; padding: 0cm; border: none;""><span>120% - (0,5 x coefficient x grams of CO2 per kilometer)</span></p>
</div>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The coefficient being:</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 36pt;""><span>-        </span><span>1 for diesel cars,</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 36pt;""><span>-        </span><span>0,95 for gas oil car and electric cars,</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;""><span>-        </span><span>0,90 for vehicles on natural gas &lt; 12 fiscal horsepower.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The deduction is maximum 100% and minimum 50%, except for cars with an emission &gt; 200 grams. For the latter, the deduction is only 40%.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Attention! This new calculation method also applies to fuel costs.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In practice, this leads in many cases to a drastic reduction in the deduction.</span></p>

<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Benefit in kind</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The calculation of the benefit in kind for the private use of a passenger car, made available to an employee by an employer, has not changed. The formula is still:</span></p>
<div style=""padding: 1pt 4pt; border-width: 1pt; border-style: solid; border-image: initial;"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; padding: 0cm; border: none;""><span>Catalogue value x age coefficient x 6/7 x CO2 percentage</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; padding: 0cm; border: none;""><span>The CO2 percentage will be 5,5 + (0,1 x (CO2 emission – reference emission))</span></p>
</div>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Only the reference emission has been adjusted. For the year 2021, this is 102 g / km for vehicles with a petrol, LPG or natural gas engine (compared to 111 g / km in 2020) and 84 g / km for vehicles with a diesel engine (compared to 91 g / km in 2020).</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The minimum benefit in kind is 1.370 Euro compared to 1.360 Euro in 2020.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Also for the employer nothing changes.  The benefit in kind remains a disallowed expense of 40 % if the employer bears the fuel costs of the car and 17 %, if this is not the case.</span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Deduction and benefit in kind for ‘fake hybrids’</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>For hybrid vehicles with plug-in that are purchased as from 1/1/2018 and that only have an energy capacity of less than 0.5 kWh per 100 kg vehicle weight or a CO2 emission of more than 50 grams per kilometre, the CO2 emission will be assimilated to that of the corresponding non-hybrid model with the same fuel (e.g. petrol). If no corresponding model is available, the CO2 emissions of the car are multiplied by 2.5. The limit value for energy capacity can be increased in the future.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The measure became into force from assessment year 2021, so for financial years that start at the earliest from 1/1/2020.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>For hybrid cars purchased before 1/1/2018, there will be no change in the CO2 emissions to be taken into account for the calculation of the deduction percentage and for the calculation of the benefit in kind. For these cars, the CO2 value of the hybrid version will continue to apply, even after January 1<sup>st</sup>  2020.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Also for normal hybrids (without plug-in), nothing changes.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>If you are in doubt whether your vehicle is considered a fake hybrid or not, you can view the list published by the FPS Finances on February 19<sup>th</sup> 2020 with an overview of the fake hybrids and the possibly corresponding vehicle.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Be careful with CO2 emissions that are stated on the offer for hybrid vehicles. Depending on the options chosen, it may happen that the CO2 emissions of the final car are higher than stated on the offer, which means that the car can be classified as a fake hybrid.</span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">CO2 measuring method</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In the past, the CO2 value of a car was measured under the NEDC method (New European Driving Cycle). Since September 2018, the European WLTP standard (Worldwide Light vehicle Testing Procedure) has been used for this measurement, which leads to higher CO2 emission levels.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Up to and including December 31<sup>st</sup> 2020, the lower of the two may be used for the calculation of the benefit and the deduction limitation. This is also the case from January 1<sup>st</sup> 2021 on the condition that the NEDC value is stated on the certificate of conformity.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Please note: from  January 1<sup>st</sup> 2021, the WLTP value for cars registered for the first time in 2021 in the name of a private person or in the name of a legal entity that is not a leasing company applies for the Flemish road tax and the vehicle registration tax.</span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Conclusion</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In view of the new deduction rules, whereby each car often obtains a different deduction percentage, it is advisable to provide a separate account for each car in the accounts on which ALL costs associated with the car in question are booked. </span><span>This also applies to fuel costs.</span></p>

Lump sum allowance for employees working from home – Fast track application and approval procedure,23/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>More and more sectors and companies are introducing compulsory homework as a result of the current Corona (Covid-19) crisis and the measures of the National Security Council. Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees can now also quickly and efficiently obtain confirmation from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an employer expense for tax purposes, exempt from tax in the hands of the employee.</span></p>
<p>To this end, an employer can obtain a straightforward ruling via an accelerated procedure at the Belgian ruling commission. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for the additional costs incurred whilst working from home during the current Corona (Covid-19) crisis. The compensation must be a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126.94 per month. No distinction must be made between different job categories within the company, but all employees who have to work at home because of the measures against the Covid-19 virus, should receive the same compensation.</p>
<p>When awarding the compensation, employers must observe some ground rules. For example, the employer must submit an application for costs specific to the employer for home work under the government measures for Covid-19, to the ruling committee. Although this may seem cumbersome, the approval procedure takes place under minimal conditions (formal but shortened application, temporary character, no double use,…).</p>

<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Specific tax measures:</span></em>
<p>In order to avoid that tax obstacles would impede the free provision of certain goods that are currently in high demand in hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus, the tax authorities have issued some temporary and exceptional tax measures. These measures will apply (for now) from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. The main points of these measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply of goods and services without consideration is principally equated for VAT purposes with a taxable supply of goods, which would lead to Belgian VAT becoming due in the hands of the supplier. In light of these exceptional circumstances, the tax authorities have therefore confirmed that no VAT should be self-assessed on the donation of certain goods (medical devices and their accessories, as well as protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients - excluding medicines) to specific institutions (mainly hospitals, associations of hospitals, hospital groups and mergers of hospitals, including hospital networks). This tolerance is subject to conditions. For example, the donor must donate the goods free of charge and, in principle, a document must be drawn up (in duplicate) for each donation that takes place. In this document the healthcare institution should confirm that the goods were obtained free of charge. The healthcare institution must undertake to either use the goods in question itself in the context of providing healthcare or to make it available to another healthcare institution free of charge;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>In addition, the administration confirms that giving away goods without consideration will also not lead to taxation in terms of corporate tax, personal income tax or non-resident tax due to abnormal or benevolent benefits granted. In addition, the administration confirms that the costs incurred in connection with the donated goods remain tax deductible. This measure only applies if the conditions regarding VAT are met;
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Certain gifts in kind to specific institutions are temporarily and exceptionally eligible for the tax reduction for gifts in personal income tax (and the tax for non-residents / natural persons). The other conditions and modalities (gift worth more than EUR 40, maximum amount, obtaining a tax certificate, ...) for the granting of the tax reduction remain applicable. It concerns gifts that consist of all kinds of medical material as well as products that are useful in the fight against the Corona virus and that are identified as such by hospitals.

<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment of Social security contributions</span></li>
<p>The federal government has granted a deferral of payments of social security contributions until December 15, 2020. The sectors of catering, recreation, culture and sports and all companies affected by a compulsory closure will automatically receive this deferral. However, the deferral until December 15, 2020 also applies to companies that are not affected by a mandatory closure, but that:</p>
<p>- are closed because they are unable to comply with sanitary measures. These companies must submit a declaration of honour.<br>
- for reasons other than not being able to comply with the sanitary measures, have decided themselves to close completely. These companies must submit a declaration of honour. </p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Payment plan for employer contributions </span></li>
<p>Companies that experience economic consequences of the Coronavirus and are having difficulties paying their social security contributions can request a payment plan from the Social Security Service for the first and second quarter of 2020. The payment plan applies for a maximum of 24 months. If the company pays its social security contributions correctly, the Social Security Service may exempt you from increases, lump sum penalties and/or interest.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Increase in the number of days of occasional work in agriculture and horticulture </span></li>
<p>Following the Coronavirus pandemic, for 2020 the number of days on which employers from agriculture and horticulture can make use of the advantageous system of occasional work, will be doubled, whereby the contributions are calculated on a fixed daily amount.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation for telework </span></li>
<p>Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees following the compulsory nature thereof, can receive a fast-track ruling (accelerated procedure) from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an expense proper to the employer, which is tax exempt for the employee. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for their compulsory homework in the framework of the fight against the Coronavirus. It must concern a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126,94 per month.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Supplement to the benefit for temporary unemployment </span></li>
<p>A company may grant its employees who are put into temporary unemployment, a supplement to the benefits the employees receive from the National Employment Service. The employer does not have to pay social security contributions on the mentioned supplement.<br>
<br>
</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Social security measures for self-employed persons:<br>
</span></em>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Deferral of payment and remittance of increases </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons may request to postpone payment of their provisional social security contributions by one year. No increases will be charged and there is no impact on your benefits./p&gt;
</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reduction of provisional social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons can request a reduction of their provisional social security contributions for the year 2020, provided their professional income is below one of the legally determined thresholds.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Exemption of social security contributions </span></li>
<p>Full-time self-employed persons and assisting spouses (including start-ups) who are unable to pay their social security contributions may request exemption from contributions. A link with the Coronavirus crisis should exist.</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">“Bridging right” – temporary crisis measure </span></li>
<p>The so-called ‘bridging right’, i.e. a monthly financial benefit, is an additional support measure for self-employed persons who have to interrupt their activity due to the Coronavirus crisis. The condition is that the self-employed person must completely or partially interrupt his activity in March and / or April 2020 due to the government's mandatory closing measures. The ‘bridging right’ can be used for a complete closure of the business, a closure at certain hours, or if the self-employed person is obliged to only work by appointment.</p>
<p>The fact that the business belongs to a sector affected by the closure measures is sufficient to be entitled to the financial benefit. The duration of the interruption is irrelevant. Even if your activity was not directly affected by the closure measures, a self-employed person may be eligible for the temporary crisis measure. To be entitled, the self-employed activity must be interrupted for at least 7 consecutive calendar days (per calendar month). The monthly financial payment for the month of March and / or April 2020 is 1.614,10 Eur (with family burden) or 1.291,69 Eur (without family burden).</p>
<p>This measure can be combined with the “Corona nuisance subsidy” on a regional level (see below).</p>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Illness and incapacity to work</span></li>
<p>Self-employed persons who have been incapacitated to work for at least 8 days are entitled to an invalidity benefit from the health insurance fund as of the first day. In some cases, the self-employed person may also ask not to pay social security contributions during the period of illness.</p>

<li><strong><span>(Un)employment measures and support for the economy</span></strong>
<ul>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary unemployment:</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Although there are two types of temporary unemployment in Belgium, i.e. for economic reasons and in case of force majeure, a broad application of the concept of 'force majeure' will be accepted from 13 March 2020 (and for the entire duration of the governmental measures) and all situations of temporary unemployment by the coronavirus will be regarded as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even though it may be possible to work for several days. There is currently no prior notification, but this may become the case in the coming weeks. In the meantime, this government measure has been extended to 19 April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may apply to:</span> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>blue collar workers and white-collar workers (from the private, public and non-profit sectors);</span></li>
<li><span>temporary workers during the term of their temporary employment contract (possibly renewable);</span></li>
<li><span>staff working in educational institutions;</span></li>
<li><span>students who follow an alternating course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Temporary unemployment due to force majeure does not apply to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>civil servants;</span></li>
<li><span>students;</span></li>
<li><span>full-time self-employed persons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition, the following additional measures are taken to limit loss of income:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unemployment benefits are temporarily increased from 65% to 70% of the average capped salary (capped at EUR 2,754.76 per month);</span></li>
<li><span>Unemployment days are equated and included in the calculation of the holiday allowance; </span></li>
<li><span>The authorities (exceptionally) grant an extra amount of EUR 5.63 per day of unemployment on top of the unemployment benefit.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Corona nuisance Subsidy (Flanders region):</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>Businesses affected by a mandatory closure receive a one-off premium of € 4,000. If additional mandatory closing measures extend the closing period after April 5, 2020, the company will receive an additional closing premium from its location for each additional closing day. This is € 160 per mandatory closing day that coincides with a normal opening day. In the meantime, the government measures have been extended to April 19, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>The Corona nuisance Subsidy can be applied for online until 5 May 2020 at <a href=""http://www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">www.aanvraagcoronapremie.be</span></a>. The required information is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>an e-id and e-id pin code or another digital key (itsme, ...).</span></li>
<li><span>An active Belgian account number of your company (IBAN format).</span></li>
<li><span>the regular opening days, as applicable before the Coronavirus measures.</span></li>
<li><span>The website address (url) of your company.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p> </p>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">• Flexibility in the execution of federal public procurement</span></em><strong><em><span>:</span></em></strong>
<p><span>For all public procurement government contracts for which can be proven that they are delayed or non-executed due to the Coronavirus crisis, the federal government will not impose fines or sanctions on service providers, companies or self-employed contractors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Loans and guarantees</span></strong></li>
<p> </p>
</ol><ul>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extension of the PMV guarantee scheme</span></em>
<p><span>The Flemish regional government decided to expand the existing ""generic"" guarantee scheme, with an additional Coronavirus crisis guarantee of 100 million euros. Via the Coronavirus guarantee scheme companies and self-employed persons can guarantee bridging loans for up to 12 months for existing non-bank debts, while this is only possible for up to 3 months for the existing guarantee scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the cost of the guarantee for the entrepreneur is reduced with 50%, to 0.25%.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, under the Coronavirus crisis guarantee, bank debts (in addition to supplier debts) of existing credit lines and investment credits that have not yet been placed under guarantee can be guaranteed insofar as the bank is also prepared to allow a minimum of 3 months payment delay or maintain credit lines. As such, the crisis guarantee serves as a catalyst for a flexible banking policy towards companies.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The federal government and financial sector reach an agreement to facilitate lending to private individuals, the self-employed and companies </span></em>
<p><span>In order to continue to ensure financing to private individuals, the self-employed and companies during this difficult period, the federal government has drawn up an agreement with the financial sector. This agreement consists of two pillars:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The financial sector is committed to defer payment to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed, as well as mortgage borrowers at risk of payment difficulties due to the corona crisis, until 30 September 2020;</span></li>
<li><span>The federal government will activate a guarantee scheme for all new credits and credit lines with a maximum term of 12 months, which will be provided by banks to viable non-financial companies and the self-employed. The purpose of this guarantee scheme is to maintain the financing of the Belgian economy.<br>
<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Insurance sector </span></em></li>
<p><span>For companies, a number of insurance policies (accidents at work, civil liability, etc.) already offer the option of adjusting the premium afterwards if there is a reduction in activity. This will be adjusted automatically. In addition, companies that are required to shut down their activities can obtain deferral of payment of their premium for all premiums that expire between March 30 and September 30 in consultation with their insurer. Finally, the same extension of payment will be applied on loans granted to companies as granted by the banking sector (until 30 September 2020). </span></p>

Temporary unemployment due to force majeure may also be invoked pending recognition as a 'company in difficulty'. Companies need this recognition to be able to put white-collar workers on temporary unemployment for economic reasons. The recognition of temporary unemployment due to force majeure will take place within three to four days. It is your social secretariat that can apply for this and follow this up. We can certainly assist you in this process, thanks to our specialised HR department, which is used to playing fast and loose with social secretariats. Benefits are temporarily increased from 65% to 70% in order to limit the loss of income. Please note that an employee who is in temporary unemployment can give notice without any form of notice.</span></p>

New rules permanent representative,23/09/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>A company that exercises a director's mandate must as a rule appoint a so-called ""permanent representative"", who represents the company in the exercise of the director's mandate. </p>
<p>The new Companies and Associations Code, which entered into force on 1 May 2019, contains a number of mandatory provisions that are already applicable to all companies as from 1 January 2020, even if the articles of association have not yet been amended. This is amongst others the case for the new provisions on the permanent representative. What follows is an overview of the changes. </p>
<p><strong>For which administrative bodies? </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Under the old code, the obligation to appoint a permanent representative was limited to legal persons who took up a position as director, manager or member of a management committee, management board or supervisory board. </p>
<p>From now on, the appointment is mandatory for all administrative bodies, i.e. also for the day-to-day director, the director of (international) non-profit organizations or foundations and even for the liquidator </p>
<p><strong>Who can be a permanent representative?</strong></p>
<p>From now on, everyone can be appointed as permanent representative of a legal person-director. There is no longer any need for a relationship with the legal person-director itself. The company-director can therefore freely appoint anyone as its permanent representative. </p>
<p>However, be careful if an employee is appointed as a permanent representative. The new code provides that the mandate as a permanent representative can only be exercised as a self-employed person. This means that the employee will have to register as a self-employed person in a secondary occupation. </p>
<p>The permanent representative must now also be a natural person. A cascade of legal persons is therefore no longer possible. Since a permanent representative is treated for tax purposes as having a ""similar position"" as that of a manager, a number of specific tax provisions that apply to managers must be taken into account. Consider, for example, the reclassification of rent received in remuneration if certain limits are exceeded. </p>
<p>Finally, there is a prohibition on cumul: a permanent representative cannot sit on the administrative body in his own name and as the permanent representative of a legal person-director.</p>
<p> <strong>Application of conflict of interest regulations</strong></p>
<p>Where in the past there has been discussion about the application of the conflict of interest rules to the permanent representative, it is now explicitly provided that this is indeed the case.</p>
<p> <strong>Sanctions </strong></p>
<p>The new code does not provide for any explicit criminal sanctions if the administrative body is not composed according to the rules. </p>
<p>However, the following must be taken into account: </p>
<p>- A decision by an administrative body that has not been composed in a regular manner is invalid. It concerns a relative nullity, which means that the nullity can be requested by any stakeholder who demonstrates that the irregularity could have influenced the deliberation or the vote.</p>
<p> - Directors who participate in an irregular administrative body commit a violation of the Code, which constitutes a qualified director’s fault. This results in the joint and several liability of all directors for the damage resulting from this. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>In order to avoid possible liabilities, companies that will not have amended their articles of association before January 1, 2020, are recommended to review the composition of their administrative body in time and to implement and publish the necessary changes before the end of 2019. Feel free to contact your usual contactperson for this.</p>

Company cars and income tax in 2020: be prepared!,13/12/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">As from January 1, 2020 there will be some important changes regarding the taxation of company cars.  Both the calculation of the tax deductible percentage for corporate tax purposes as well as the calculation of the benefit in kind for hybrid cars are amended.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Tax deductible percentage</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Until the end of 2019, the tax deduction is determined on the basis of the CO2 emission of the car taking into account the kind of fuel, leading to a tax deduction between 50% and 120%. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">As from January 1, 2020, the tax deduction will be calculated according to the following formula:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""border:0.5pt solid #000000;margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt; padding: 1pt 4pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Basis of 120 - (50% of (CO2 emission x correction percentage)) = deductible percentage</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The correction percentages are 95% for a car on gasoline and 90% for a car on CNG if the fiscal HP stays under 12.   The deduction percentage cannot fall below 40%, nor can it exceed 100%. The favourable 120% deduction for electric cars expires. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The new formula will also apply on the fuel costs where they were tax deductible for 75% before. </span></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">First let’s consider the concept of hybrid or fake-hybrid.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">A </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">plug-in hybrid</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> is considered to be a hybrid for tax purposes if the CO2 emission is a maximum of 50 grams </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">and</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> the battery capacity exceeds 0.5 KWH per 100 kg. The bigger the battery, the better. With this rule, all large and heavier cars almost certainly fall into the fake hybrid category. A </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">full hybrid</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">, one without a plug, is always a tax hybrid. This rule applies to all hybrid cars that were purchased after 1/1/2018.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Until now, the CO2 emission stated on the registration certificate is used to calculate the benefit in kind. This is the NEDC value for the vehicle including the hybrid module. In almost all cases, this was a low value with a favourable benefit in kind.  From 2020, however, it will be necessary to verify whether or not the hybrid is fake. With a fake hybrid we have to use the CO2 value of a similar fuel engine without the hybrid module. If this is not available, we must multiply the CO2 emission by 2.5.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">NEDC, NEDC 2.0 and WLTP CO2 emission standards</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The CO2 emission has been expressed in a NEDC value for a long time. This was a theoretical value which came under pressure after the Diesel gate because it was not realistic enough. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">From September 1, 2018, a new WLTP standard was introduced that would be more truthful. Because cars from before this date have no WLTP emissions, a NEDC 2.0 has been created to make older cars more compatible with the WLTP standard.  In practice, the WLTP standard is in almost all cases higher than the NEDC standard.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Both the Flemish government and the Federal government have confirmed that the NEDC standard will be applied up to and including 2020. From 2021, the WLTP emissions will have to be used in taxation, although it is not yet clear whether this rule applies suddenly to all cars or only to those registered after 1/1/2021. </span></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">December is traditionally a busy month for HR professionals, payroll agencies and others that are involved with payroll.  After all, December is the last month of the income year and the payment and settlement of salaries must be correct.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">What follows is an overview of some items that deserve special attention.</span></p>

Whether an employer has to pay a thirteenth month depends on the regulations in force in the joint committee and therefore depends on the sector. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">In most sectors there is a collective labour agreement (CAO) that determines the right to a 13</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">th</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> month.  All employees from these sectors will therefore be entitled to a 13</span><span style=""color: #000000;"">th</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> month, insofar they meet the conditions (for example, a certain seniority in the company) that are stipulated by the CAO.</span></p>

Cross border employment and social security within Europe,13/12/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Social security costs differ across Europe so it is vital to understand the basics of the cross border rules that apply so your organisation can stay compliant and avoid unnecessary costs, dual contributions and complexity.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Organisations often request employees to work across borders. In some scenarios the cross-border working arises due to the particulars of the employee rather than at the request of the business. For example, the employee may have relocated himself to a new country but continued in the same role. In these scenarios employer and employee taxes and related payroll need to be reviewed. Social security is a key consideration. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">In this article we will discuss the social security position in the EU area and the use of the so-called A1 Form. Common rules for what is known as social security coordination apply to EU member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Amongst the main purposes of the rules is the concept that social security contributions should be payable only in one country (at any given time). As a result, dual social security liabilities should be avoided.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #2e75b5;"">What is an A1 Form?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The A1 form certifies which country social security rules or legislation (exclusively) apply to the holder of the form. This effectively confirms the country in which social security contributions are due.  The form will generally be needed in situations where a person has a connection with more than one EU-country, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The A1 Form is based on the rules contained within European Directive (883/2004) that provides the cross border social security coordination rules. This Directive not only deals with rules for employees, but amongst others also for self-employed persons, civil servants, benefit recipients, pilots/cabin crew etc. We will focus on the rules for employees.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Coordination rules that determine which country social security rules and legislation (and therefore social security contributions) apply: </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The main rule (and starting point) for employees is that the social security legislation of the country where the work is performed is applicable. In special cases or when an employee works in more than one country, there are exceptions to this rule. Below the most common ones are highlighted.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span><span style=""color: #000000;"">When the employee is sent by the employer to work temporarily in another country on his behalf for a maximum period (initially) of 24 months, the employee will remain subject to the legislation of the country were posted from.</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span>When the employee is performing duties in more than one country at the same time, or in alteration, then the employee will be subject to the legislation of the country of his residence provided that the employee works at least 25% of his time in his country of residence. If it is less than 25%, then the employee will be subject to the legislation of the country where the employer is located.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;"">As an exception, two or more of the involved countries may by common agreement determine that the employee will be subject to the legislation of the country other than that provided by the normal rules. The A1 form will confirm to which legislation the employee is subject.</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #2e75b5;"">Where and when to obtain an A1 form</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">If the employee goes to work temporarily in another country, the employer will normally apply for the A1 from the relevant authority/institution in the home country (country where sent from). Employees who normally pursue activities in more than one country, apply for the A1 in the country of residence. When an exception to the normal coordination rules is appropriate, the A1 application is made to the authority/institution in the country where the employee would like to be subject to the legislation. Whenever possible, the application should be made </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">before</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> the duties begin in the other country. The legislation determined as being applicable on the Form A1 is normally binding on all countries. The Form should be retained and made available for presentation to the institutions in the countries the employee is working in.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #2e75b5;"">Payroll consequences</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The Form A1 confirms the country in which social security is payable. The same form also acts as confirmation that social security is therefore not due in the country the employee is working in.  This form is therefore a very important document to retain for payroll audits.  In some scenarios the social security legislation applies in a country that is different to the country where the employee is employed and on payroll. In these scenarios, the employer will need to be registered and payroll deductions, payments and reporting will apply. It may well be that taxes (wage / payroll taxes) will also have to be paid (and potentially withheld via the payroll). This would mean that a split or shadow payroll may also have to be implemented. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #2e75b5;"">Conclusion</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">It’s important to understand the basic rules that apply in Europe. This understanding will help ensure payroll compliance and prevent costly dual social security contributions. </span></p>

Changes in corporate income taxation as from 2020 and how to anticipate?,13/12/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">As from tax year 2021 (financial years as from January 1, 2020) the last new corporate tax reform measures, as introduced by the 2018 summer agreement, enter into force.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">What follows is an overview.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Decrease of the tax rate</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The nominal rate of corporation tax further decreases to 25% for large companies and to 20% on the first bracket of EUR 100,000 for SME’s.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Optional taxation of tax-free reserves</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">For the taxation of certain tax-free reserves, a temporary favourable rate of 15% (or 10% in case of appropriate investment) is foreseen.  This favourable rate only applies for the financial years 2020 and 2021 and applies to the taxation of investment reserves, profits of ‘inschakelbedrijven’, exempt reserves corresponding to 20% of the costs of electric vehicles, etc., recorded before 1/1/2017.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Attention: the amount of these taxed reserves constitutes the minimum taxable basis on which no deductions are possible. Therefore, tax will effectively be due.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Whether a taxpayer with tax deductions has the choice to have these reserves taxed at the normal rate and therefore can make use of his tax deductions, is not clear. If you are in this situation, you may still have these reserves taxed in the financial year 2019.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Minimum taxable basis</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The minimum taxable basis for non or late filing of the tax return is raised to EUR 40,000, so that at least EUR 10,000 of tax is always due.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Measures related to investments</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The increased </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">investment deduction</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> of 20% for new investments by SME’s in 2018 and 2019, will no longer apply to investments as from January 1, 2020. As a result, the normal investment deduction of 8% will apply again.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Furthermore, SME’s at this moment must not apply a </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">pro rata depreciation</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> if the investment is made during the year, even at the end of December. This means that an asset can be depreciated at any time as if it had been in the possession of the company for a whole year. This rule was no longer applicable for large companies and is now also being abolished for SME’s as from January 1, 2020.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Furthermore, it will no longer be possible to apply the </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">double declining balance depreciation</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> method on investments made as from January 1, 2020, so that for all new investments the straight line depreciation method should be used. This means a lower depreciation cost in the first years.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Finally, until December 31, 2019, </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">additional costs</span><span style=""color: #000000;""> can be written off either in one time or according to the rhythm of the asset concerned or at will. The latter is no longer possible as from January 1, 2020.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Reasons enough to still make an investment before the end of the year instead of waiting until next year!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Deduction of foreign permanent establishment losses</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Only final losses from permanent establishments located in an EEA country will still be tax deductible. This is thus only the case at the moment of cessation of the activities abroad.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">There will no longer be any possibility of deducting losses from permanent establishments in non-EEA countries. It may therefore be considered to close this establishment before the end of this year.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Abolition of certain favourable regimes</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">A number of favourable regimes are definitively abolished. This is among other things the case for the exemption for additional staff and trainees, the 120% deduction for costs of public transport and electric cars, etc.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Maximum deductible interest on C/A positions</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The maximum deductible interest on  C/A positions will be based on the average interest rates of the National Bank + 2.5%.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #1f4e79;"">Conclusion</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">A number of the aforementioned measures will have a negative impact on the determination of the taxable basis as from January 1, 2020 and therefore on the corporation income tax due.   Where possible, you can still anticipate in 2019.</span></p>

Monthly VAT refund for startups as of the 1st of January 2020,23/09/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Under current Belgian VAT legislation, companies are only entitled to claim a refund of their VAT credit with the Belgian VAT authorities on a quarterly basis, unless the company has applied for and acquired a monthly VAT refund license. In practice, many companies do not meet the condition to apply for a monthly refund license. For start-ups, which often incur a lot of VAT on investment costs and only have a limited amount of VAT due on turnover realized, the prefinancing of VAT can result in a significant cost.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Startups should be supported as much as possible. Therefore, starting January 1<sup>st</sup> 2020, startups will be offered the opportunity to reclaim VAT credits, relating to VAT that became chargeable during the first 24 months after the start of the economic activity, on a monthly basis. To benefit from this new possibility, the startup must submit monthly VAT returns. In practice however, many startups currently opt to file quarterly VAT returns. In addition, the VAT credit must be at least 245 Euro before companies can request a VAT refund. These principles will be implemented in the Belgian VAT legislation. However, it is to be expected that the VAT authorities will issue additional guidelines with regard to the practical application of the new monthly VAT refund for startups.</span></p>

VAT Committee (Working Paper No 968): interesting views on the concept of a fixed establishment for VAT purposes,19/06/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The European VAT Committee has recently published a new Working Paper on the implementation of “the Quick Fixes Package”, which will come into effect as of the 1<sup>st</sup> of January 2020. Part of the subject matter covered, is the question whether a call-off stock warehouse can be considered to be a fixed establishment of the supplier. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>As is commonly known, the guidelines and views of the VAT Committee do not have legal effect, yet, often provide a view on how VAT related issues and open questions should be answered. Therefore, it is worth noting the considerations of the VAT committee. Especially, as the committee’s views do not seem to be in line with the current Belgian administrative point of views and practice.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In the above mentioned guidelines, the delegates raised the issue whether for the purposes of Article 17a of the VAT Directive the supplier could be the stock keeper in the Member State of arrival of the goods without necessarily being seen as having a fixed establishment for VAT purposes there. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>This is a relevant question as one of the conditions for the call-off stock simplification to apply is that the supplier has not established his business nor has a fixed establishment in the Member State to which the goods are dispatched or transported. Therefore it is important to know whether the supplier having a warehouse to which he moves his own goods would automatically be excluded from the call-off stock arrangements simplification because of him being seen as having a fixed establishment in the Member State of the arrival of goods.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has dealt on various occasions with the issue of fixed establishment. In accordance with the CJEU’s case law any such an establishment must be characterized by a sufficient degree of permanence and a suitable structure in terms of human and technical resources to enable it to supply services or to receive and use the services supplied to it for its own needs. It is important to underline that the CJEU has focused on the notion of fixed establishment only in relation to the rules on place of supply of services. In this context the CJEU held that the application of the rules should lead to a rational result, avoiding conflicts between Member States.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In order to detail its views, the VAT Committee went into detail on various scenarios that could arise.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Firstly, in the situation where the warehouse is owned and run by the acquirer or in the case where the warehouse is owned and run by a third person, different from the supplier and the acquirer, the committee is of the opinion that this (call-off stock) warehouse is not a fixed establishment of the supplier.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Secondly, in the situation where the supplier owns the warehouse, in the Commission services’ opinion, he does have a sufficient degree of permanence/material link with the warehouse to see it as creating a fixed establishment for him. This would be so regardless of whether he is running the warehouse himself or rents it out to another person. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>If the supplier, apart from owning the call-off stock warehouse, is also running it (indirectly or through his own employees) with the aim of supplying the goods to his clients then he should be seen as having a suitable, sufficiently permanent, structure not only in terms of technical resources but also in terms of human resources, which allows to consider the warehouse as his fixed establishment in the Member State where it is located.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>If the supplier is renting the warehouse to a third person (who still allows the supplier to store his own goods there) then the supplier is providing a rental service, the warehouse being the object of that rental service. It seems that the warehouse should be seen as an establishment characterized by a sufficient degree of permanence and a suitable structure in terms of human and technical resources to enable the supplier to provide the rental service. The warehouse would therefore have to be seen as his fixed establishment (of the supplier) in the Member State of arrival of the goods.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Thirdly, and most interestingly in our view, the VAT Committee assesses the situation in which the warehouse is owned by a third party (who has rented it to the supplier) and where the supplier is also hiring an independent third party that will run it for him. According to the VAT committee, in this situation, the supplier should be seen as having a fixed establishment in the Member State concerned. </span></p>

Minimum taxable profit increased,23/09/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>Until tax year 2018 companies risked to be taxed on a minimum profit of EUR 19.000 in case of no or late filing of their corporate income tax return. This minimum taxable profit has now been increased to EUR 34.000 as from tax year 2019 (accounting years started as from January 1, 2018) and will increase further to EUR 40.000 as from tax year 2021 (accounting years as from January 1, 2020). </p>
<p>In case of repeated non or late filing the amount is further increased as follows:</p>
<p> - In the event of a second infringement: 25% - In the event of a third infringement: 50% </p>
<p>- In the event of a fourth infringement: 100% - In the event of a fifth infringement: 200% A previous non or late filing is not taken into account to determine the percentage increase, if no infringement is penalized for the last 4 assessment years preceding the assessment year for which the new infringement is committed. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>In order to avoid the taxation on the above mentioned minimum profits, make sure to file your corporate tax return in time!</p>

The member state in which VAT was incurred can request additional documentation. </span></p>

Brexit: is your company ready?,,,,https://www.crowe.com/be/spark/insights/brexit-is-your-company-ready
"Already considered the practical impact of the 2020 ""VAT quick fixes""?",23/09/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>As of the 1st of January 2020, some limited changes (the so-called ""VAT quick fixes"") will be implemented in EU VAT legislation with the aim of solving four practical VAT problems in international trade. </p>
<p>Before raising some practical considerations and question, please find a concise description of the VAT quick fixes. </p>
<p><strong>1. Call-off stocks: simplification and harmonization </strong></p>
<p>Today, it has become common for suppliers to store their own goods in a warehouse or another location of a customer abroad. To avoid VAT formalities abroad, as of the 1st of January 2020, the transfer of own goods in the context of such a stock will no longer be treated as a deemed intra-Community supply of goods for consideration. Under certain conditions and as long as the goods are actually sold to the customer within 12 months, there will be a direct intra-Community supply of goods from the supplier to the customer. </p>
<p><strong>2. Allocation of transport in chain transactions </strong></p>
<p>In situations where consecutive supplies of goods take place between several taxable persons in different Member States and where only one (intra-Community) transport takes place, it must be investigated to which relation the transport can be allocated. After all, the VAT exemption for the intra-Community supply of goods can only be applied on one sale in this chain. From 1 January 2020 on, transport in a chain transactions will be allocated to the transaction in which the sale takes place to the party who is contractually responsible (himself or via a third party) for the transport of the goods. However, if the latter party communicates its (own) VAT number in the member state of departure of the goods to the supplier, the transport will be allocated to the subsequent commercial transaction in which the intra-Community transport of the goods takes place. </p>
<p><strong>3. Valid VAT number of the customer: material condition for the application of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies </strong></p>
<p>Currently, obtaining a valid VAT number from the customer (in another EU Member State) is a formal requirement for the application of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies of goods (""substance over form"" principle). From January 1, 2020, the receipt of a valid EU VAT number from the customer and the submission of an intra-Community declaration are considered as a material requirement. If these conditions are not met, the supplier must apply VAT to his invoice, as the application of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supply of goods is no longer allowed. </p>
<p><strong>4. Simplified proof of intra-Community transport </strong></p>
<p>The fourth ""quick fix"" aims to resolve the practical difficulties business face with the required proof of intra-Community transport. This ""VAT quick fix"" implements a rebuttable presumption that an intra-Community transport has taken place when a taxable person can present two (or more) non-conflicting proofs of transport issued by two independent parties. </p>
<p><strong>Practical impact and considerations</strong></p>
<p>Although the changes are limited, they have a major practical impact. Enterprises should: </p>
<ol>
<li> assess the impact of these changes on the current VAT treatment of their trade flows. </li>
</ol>
<p>         A few of the many questions that may arise are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the transport currently allocated in accordance with the new rules? </li>
<li>Which contractual transport agreements are currently in force with my suppliers and customers? </li>
<li>Do the new rules on the allocation of transport in chain sales create VAT registration obligations for my company in other EU Member States? </li>
<li>Does my company have call-off stocks abroad? Should the current VAT treatment be reconsidered? </li>
<li>Should my ERP master data and ERP tax logic be changed?</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>2. examine whether new procedures should be implemented in the organizational structure, for example with regard to obtaining or archiving transport documentation, periodical       <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>verification of the validity of customers' VAT numbers, investigation of the absence of conflicts in the proof of transport, etc.;</p>
<p>Crowe is ready to investigate what impact your company will experience from the VAT quick fixes or to assist with the implementation of new procedures and (commercial) guidelines. Do not hesitate to contact your Crowe contact person if you need assistance with this.</p>

Mobility allowance versus mobility budget: what’s in a name?,01/04/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>In the context of striving for sustainable mobility, a number of measures have been introduced by the government that should be an attractive alternative to the company car.</span></p>
<p><span>The first concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility allowance</span> that was introduced as per January 1, 2018. This allowance offers employees the opportunity to trade in their company car for a monthly cash allowance = cash for car.</span></p>
<p><span>The second concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility budget</span> that is applicable as from March 1, 2019. The mobility budget means that an employee can trade in his company car up to a certain amount for a more environmentally friendly and cheaper car. The rest of the budget can then be spent on sustainable means of transport such as a subscription to public transport, a car sharing system, a bicycle allowance, etc. Any balance will be paid out in cash at the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that both measures apply, it is time for a comparative overview.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Comparison of both measures</em></strong></p>
<p><span>The award conditions are identical, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The employer must have made a company car available to at least one employee for at least 36 months.  Start-up companies that have not been in operation for 36 months can still offer the systems if they already have company cars in their pay packages for 12 months.</span></li>
<li><span>The employee must have been entitled to a company car for at least 12 months in the 36 months prior to the application, of which at least 3 months must be uninterrupted before the application.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>However, they do not apply when an employee is recruited or promoted or in case of a function change before 1 March 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, neither of these measures are mandatory: the employer is not required to offer them and the employee is not required to accept them!</span></p>
<p><span>The main differences are in the following areas:</span></p>

Belgian social security contributions on benefits from an affiliated company to a Belgian employee?,05/12/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>Recently a new position was taken by the Belgian social security authorities in respect of the liability to Belgian social security contributions of benefits granted by a foreign parent company to employees working in Belgium for a local subsidiary.  </span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">What has changed?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>This was achieved by a broader interpretation of the definition of what needs to be understood as ‘salary’.</p>
<p>‘Salary’ is described as every benefit in cash or valuable in cash:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>That is granted by an employer to its employee  <strong>in return </strong>for work performed under an employment contract</span></li>
<li><span>To which the employee is entitled following an employment and that is <strong>borne by </strong>the employer, <strong>directly</strong> or <strong>indirectly</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>In the past</em> the social security authorities took the position that a benefit was indirectly borne by the employer when, without bearing the financial cost of the benefit, the employer acted as a single point of contact to which the employees could turn to if they did not receive the benefit.</p>
<p><span>Following this position, benefits received from the parent company or another group company by a Belgian employee without any intervention of his actual Belgian employer, would not qualify as salary and therefore no Belgian social security contributions were due.</span></p>
<p><em>In their administrative instructions of the third quarter of 2018</em>, this position was adjusted in that sense that when an employee receives a benefit following his labour agreement with his Belgian employer, irrespective of who grants the benefit, this should <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">always</span> be subject to Belgian social security contributions.</p>
<p>As from when this new position will enter into force is not clear yet.  Further there is some doubt as to the legality of this new position.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">What does that mean?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>This means that on any benefit that is granted to a Belgian employee following his employment with his employer, Belgian social security contributions will be due. </p>
<span>This would f.e. apply on RSU granted by foreign group companies to employees working in Belgium.</span>

VAT and immovable rent: administrative guidelines published,01/04/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>Since the publication and entry into force of the Law of 14 October 2018 amending the Belgian VAT Code and implementing the new optional VAT regime for immovable rent, administrative guidelines accompanying this new legislation were expected to be published.</p>
<p>In addition to the administrative notice of 9 January 2019 on the reimbursement of historical VAT as a result of the optional taxation of immovable rental, the VAT administration published a new Circular letter on 21 March 2019 (Circular letter 2019/C/25).</p>
<p><strong>Administrative notice: Reimbursement of historical VAT  as a result of the optional taxation of immovable rental.</strong></p>
<p>The new VAT option for immovable rental allows for (historical) input VAT to be deducted. As a result, for VAT that became chargeable before 1 January 2019, which in the past was often not or not fully deductable, a refund can be claimed going forward.</p>
<p>To mitigate the budgetary impact of the refund of historical VAT, the VAT authorities foresee a staggered refund. More specifically, the notice stipulates that the amount of the historically refundable VAT must be set off against the amount of VAT due as it arises periodically in the VAT returns (box 71) as from the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>If after this settlement an amount of historical VAT is still eligible for refund, this VAT credit is transferred to the following VAT reporting periods until no further VAT credit remains.<span style=""color: red;""> </span></p>
<p>Please note however that the amount of the VAT credit, that cannot be settled in the first eleven monthly VAT returns or the first three quarterly VAT returns of the year 2019, can be deducted (in full) in the monthly VAT return of December 2019 or the VAT return for the fourth quarter of the year 2019, regardless of the end result of these declarations.</p>
<p>Finally, and not without importance, the administration states that the VAT taxable person who wishes to reclaim historical VAT must provide the competent VAT office with an inventory of the goods and services on which he wants to reclaim historical VAT.</p>
<p><strong>Circular Letter 2019/C/25: FAQ regarding the application of the new legislation in the field of immovable rent</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned administrative notice, the VAT administration has published a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on 21 March 2019.</p>
<p>The FAQ provides an insight into the practical application of the VAT option for immovable rent. Practical guidance is given on: which type of immovable property is eligible for the new option, whether parts of immovable property can be subject to the VAT option for immovable rent, whether vacancy has an impact on the initial VAT deducted, etc. The published administrative guidelines are to a large extent in line with what became previously known through the parliamentary documents and author texts.</p>
<p>In addition, the FAQ provides guidance on the application of the mandatory application of VAT for short-term (max. six-month duration) immovable rent (which could previously also be considered VAT exempt). Practical guidance is given on: which type of short-term immovable rent is meant, how the six-month period should be calculated (e.g. in the case of successive contracts), etc.</p>
<p>Finally, the FAQ provides an explanation of the new administrative guidelines regarding the rental of storage facilities. The published administrative guidelines are on these topics also in line with what became previously known through the parliamentary documents and author texts.</p>
<span>The extensive FAQ can be found on fisconet.be. We wish you a lot of reading pleasure. Alternatively, please feel free to contact your Crowe contact person for further explanation of these new administrative guidelines.</span>

Tax consequences of the incorporation theory in the new company law code,19/06/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>Following the corporate law reform that entered into force as per May 1, 2019, Belgium adopted the ‘incorporation theory’ while previously it adhered the ‘real seat theory’.  </span></p>
<p><span>The applicable theory is important to determine the ‘nationality’ of a company and hence the company law it is subject to. </span></p>
<p>According to the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">incorporation theory</span>, a company is subject to the company code of the country where it has its registered seat while according to the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">real seat theory</span>, it is the country of the  actual centre of management, administration and/or business activity whose company law applies. </p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Corporate law versus tax law</em></strong></p>
<p>For tax purposes however the real seat continues to prevail.  This means that a company is subject to the income tax code of the country where its centre of management is situated. </p>
<p>Thus a dissociation is created between the ‘nationality’ and the ‘tax residence’ of a company.</p>
<p>In practice it is therefore possible that a company is subject to Belgian corporate law because it has its registered seat in Belgium while for tax purposes it is subject to the corporate income tax of the country where it has its actual seat.</p>
<p><span>Vice versa, a company with registered seat abroad and actual seat in Belgium will be subject to foreign company law and Belgian income tax law.  </span></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Rebuttable presumption in tax law</em></strong></p>
<p>It is presumed that a company that has its registered office in Belgium also has its seat of management and therefore its tax residence in Belgium.</p>
<p><span>This presumption can however be refuted by proving that the actual seat of management is situated abroad, and that the company is a tax resident of the other state under both domestic law and the tax treaty.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Accounting principles</em></strong></p>
<p>Companies that are subject to foreign company law but are taxable in Belgium, are subject to foreign accounting rules.  As the taxable basis needs to be determined according to Belgian standards,  those companies must comply with Belgian accounting rules.</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Foreign bodies without legal personality</em></strong></p>
<p>To be subject to corporate income taxation, the company needs to have legal personality. For foreign bodies with legal personality that are taxable in Belgium because they have their actual seat in Belgium there is no problem.  They are subject to Belgian corporate taxation as a domestic company.</p>
<p>Foreign bodies without legal personality are also fiscally treated as a company provided they have a legal form that is similar to the one of a Belgian company.  If not, taxation arises at the level of their partners.</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion </em></strong></p>
<p>Following the introduction of the incorporation theory in the new company law, some adjustments were made to the corporate tax code to ensure fiscal neutrality.</p>

Impact of Brexit on corporate taxation in Belgium,14/03/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>At the time of writing this article it looks like we are heading for a hard Brexit. This means that the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the European Union (EU).  What follows is an overview of the consequences of this in the field of corporate taxation in Belgium.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Impact on corporate taxation</em></strong></p>
<p><span>As the UK will no longer be part of the EU, the EU Directives will no longer apply. This means that Belgian companies in their relationship to the UK will no longer be able to rely on the guidelines included in the Directives in case these were not implemented in domestic law.  The tax treaty between Belgium and the UK will remain fully applicable.   </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Cross-border dividend distributions</em></strong></p>
<p><span>Brexit will not have much impact on cross-border dividend distributions between Belgium and the UK.  </span></p>
<p><span>According to the <em>Parent/Subsidiary Directive</em>, no withholding tax is due if certain conditions are met (minimum shareholding of at least 10%, held for at least 1 year). </span></p>
<p><span>In case the subsidiary is a Belgian company, Belgium will continue to apply the exemption of withholding tax on <strong>dividend distributions</strong> (provided the above conditions are met), since according to Belgian domestic law the exemption applies to all parent companies being tax resident in a country with which Belgium has concluded a tax treaty with a clause for the exchange of information, which is the case with the UK.</span></p>
<p><span>For <strong>dividends received</strong> by a Belgian parent company a dividend exemption applies if certain conditions are met (minimum shareholding of at least 10%, held for at least 1 year, the subsidiary meets the subject to tax requirement).   </span></p>
<p><span>Dividends from an EU subsidiary are fully exempt. If however the dividend comes from a non EU subsidiary, the exemption does not apply on some disallowed expenses.  </span></p>
<p><span>For dividends coming from a subsidiary in the EU, the subject to tax requirement is deemed to be met anyhow. However in case the dividend comes from a subsidiary in a non EU country, its nominal corporate income tax rate should at least be 15%, if not the exemption does not apply at all.  Although the nominal tax rate in the UK is actually 19% going down to 17% as from April 1, 2020, it has been announced that it will likely decrease further to less than 15%. It is not clear whether the equal treatment clause in the tax treaty between Belgium and the UK is broad enough so as to cover the dividend exemption after a rate decrease below 15%.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Cross-border interest and royalty payments</em></strong></p>
<p><span>The actual exemption of withholding tax based on the <em>Interest/Royalty Directive</em> would no longer apply but in this case the double tax treaty offers relief.</span></p>
<p><span>In case of cross-border interest and royalty payments between enterprises, there is an exemption provided certain formalities are fulfilled. The formalities however involve the intervention of the tax administration of both countries and increase the administrative burden. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Cross-border reorganisations</em></strong></p>
<p><span>Following the <em>Merger directive</em>, cross border reorganisations within the EU can, under certain conditions, be implemented in a tax neutral way. This is no longer possible when the UK is no part of the EU any more. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Other EU-Directives and regulations</em></strong></p>
<p><span>What about other EU-Directives like the ATAD Directive (Anti-Tax Avoidance) or the Directive for administrative cooperation and exchange of information? Or the draft Directive on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base or the measurements for taxation of the digital economy?</span></p>
<p><span>These will not apply (anymore).</span></p>
<p><strong><em>What if the UK would also no longer be part of the European Economic Area (EEA)</em></strong>?</p>
<p><span>In this case, a number of other measures are also compromised, amongst others:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>the newly introduced system of tax consolidation (applicable as from tax year 2020)</span></li>
<li>the off-setting of final losses of a permanent established in the UK against Belgian profits (as from tax year 2021)</li>
<li>the tax shelter regime</li>
<li>the possibility to pay the exit tax over 5 years</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>

Belgian salary tax on benefits granted by foreign affiliated companies,19/06/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>In a previous newsletter, we already mentioned the new position that was taken by the Belgian social security authorities in respect of the liability to Belgian social security contributions of benefits granted by a foreign parent company to employees working in Belgium for a local subsidiary.</span></p>
<p>Also the tax authorities now formally introduced a new withholding and reporting obligation through payroll for remunerations and benefits received by a Belgian employee from a foreign affiliated company of his Belgian employer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>What is this about?</em></strong></p>
<p>In an international context, it is very common that employees of a Belgian company receive benefits from the foreign parent or other affiliated company of the Belgian employer.  These benefits are then granted on the basis of a foreign plan.  In this respect stock options or free shares (RSU) immediately come into mind but of course also other benefits are envisaged.</p>
<p>The benefits thus received by the Belgian employee are  undeniably ‘taxable’ benefits.</p>
<p>In the past the Belgian employer was only required to withhold salary tax on these benefits if he actively intervened in the granting of the benefits, which was in practice often not the case.  Consequently, no salary tax was deducted from the benefits and it was up to the employees to declare the benefits in their tax return. The latter however was sometimes ‘forgotten’ by the employees concerned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Remediation</em></strong></p>
<p>To meet the oblivion of the employees, a legal fiction has now been introduced whereby the Belgian employer is deemed to have granted the benefits (and possibly other remuneration) himself.  Therefore he is required to withhold salary tax.</p>
<p>The new obligation applies for salary paid and benefits granted <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">as from March 1, 2019</span>.  In this context, the term ‘granted’ must be understood as ‘becoming taxable’.  This means that every amount that becomes taxable as from March 1, 2019 must be reported through payroll even if the actual grant took place before that date.  For instance, in case of stock options and RSU granted, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">every exercise</span> or <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">vesting as from March 1, 2019</span>, also from a prior plan, should be reported.</p>
<p>This means that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">as from March 1, 2019</span>, all benefits must be reported through payroll on a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">monthly</span> basis.</p>
<p>The question has arisen whether the reporting obligation in the Belgian payroll should be seen as an ‘involvement’ of the employer, automatically leading to Belgian social security contributions (see our previous newsletter). This does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #2e74b5;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><em>What does this mean in practice?</em></strong></p>
<p>As from March 1, 2019, it is therefore important to include the information regarding remuneration received from and benefits granted by foreign affiliated companies on a monthly basis in the payroll.</p>
<p>So please, make sure that you receive this information in time!  In case the Belgian employer does not fulfil the obligation to withhold salary tax, he will risk penalties and fines.</p>
<p>This also means that the taxable amounts are automatically included on the employees’ salary form 281.10.</p>
<p>Please note that salary paid/benefits granted by foreign group companies for the period from January 1, 2019 until February 28, 2019, will need to be reported on a special salary form before March 1, 2020. The format of this form is yet still to be determined.</p>

Belgium introduces CFC,05/12/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>As from assessment year 2020, i.e. financial years starting 1 January 2019 or later, taxable profit of a Belgian parent company should include ‘artificial’, low-taxed, undistributed profits of controlled foreign companies or establishments.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Requirements:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>- Control: holding directly or indirectly 50% of the voting rights or shares, or being entitled to at least 50% of profit, </span></p>
<p><span>- Low tax: the foreign company is either not subject to income tax or is subject to income tax less than half of the Belgian income tax if calculated according to Belgian rules,</span></p>
<p><span>- Artificial: (part of) the income of the foreign entity is generated by assets or risks, which it would not have had or assumed if it was not controlled by the Belgian company, which is performing the key functions for those assets and risks; that part is determined on the basis of transfer pricing methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Take away</span></em></strong></p>
<span>Belgian companies should make an inventory of any situations possibly in scope of CFC legislation. However we are of the opinion that, when transfer pricing requirements are met, the risk is likely going to be remote.</span>

Exit tax scope is broadened,05/12/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>Belgium already had exit tax rules for the emigration of Belgian companies and for the transfer of a permanent establishment abroad. As from assessment year 2020, i.e. financial years starting 1 January 2019 or later, the scope of Belgian exit tax rules is being broadened.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Outbound asset transfers to treaty-exempt foreign PE</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Belgium will be entitled to tax the hidden gains that exist at the time of the transfer of assets from a Belgian company to its foreign establishment, the profits of which are exempt in Belgium under a tax treaty. </span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Inbound asset transfers </span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>For inbound transactions a step-up will be available in Belgium if the unrealized capital gain on the transferred assets has been included in the taxable base in exit state.</span></p>
<p><span>In following cases the Belgian tax value (for future depreciations, capital gains and losses, etc.) will be the fair market value at the time of the transfer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Transfer from a foreign permanent establishment to the Belgian head office</span></li>
<li><span> </span>Transfer from a foreign company’s head office to its Belgian establishment;</li>
<li>Transfer from a foreign company’s foreign establishment to its Belgian establishment; and</li>
<li>Transfer from a foreign establishment to Belgium (hence becoming a Belgian establishment).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em><span>Requirements:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>(1) the gain has been effectively included in the taxable base in the exit state; and</span></p>
<p><span>(2) Belgium has concluded a tax treaty with the exit state that provides for an exchange of information.</span></p>
<p><span>Where the above rules do not apply, the fair market value will be deemed to equal the acquisition or investment value less the write-offs and depreciations in accordance with the Belgian tax rules, unless counterproof.</span></p>

A novelty for Belgium - Tax consolidation,05/12/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>For the first time in Belgian tax history, Belgium introduces tax consolidation, as from assessment year 2020, i.e. financial years starting 1 January 2019 or later.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Group contribution</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>The Belgian system will not require establishing consolidated accounts as it uses a ‘group contribution’ system: Belgian profitable entities (companies or PE’s of EEA companies) will be able to transfer (part of their) taxable profits (i.e. to make a ‘group contribution’) to a Belgian loss making affiliated entity (company or PE of EEA companies). The loss making entity can set-off the group contribution received against its current year tax losses and the profitable entity gets a tax-deduction for the ‘group contribution’ made.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Requirements?</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>- Companies should be affiliated =</span></p>
<p><span>- parent and subsidiary companies with direct participation of at least 90%</span></p>
<p><span></span>- sister companies with the same parent (in Belgium or EEA) where the parent has a direct participation of at least 90% in the sisters</p>
<p><span>- for an uninterrupted period of 5 years, and</span></p>
<p><span>- they should per taxable period conclude a ‘group contribution’ agreement that must meet certain requirements;</span></p>
<p><span>- the (profitable) entity will have to financially compensate the (loss-making) entity for the tax benefit resulting from the tax-deductible ‘group contribution’ made;  </span>this compensation is non-deductible for the paying company and exempt for the receiving company.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Take-away</span></em></strong></p>

- Beneficiaries who are members of the same group as the debtor (= affiliated companies).</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"">The new scheme as from January 1, 2019 </span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>For accounting years starting from January 1, 2019 (tax year 2020), the current thin cap scheme is largely replaced by a new interest deduction limitation, under the influence of the European ATAD directive (Anti Tax Avoidance Directive).<br>
<br>
Based on this new deduction limitation, the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">net</span> borrowing cost (= the so-called financing cost surplus being the positive difference between the total amount of interest charges and the total amount of interest income) is not deductible to the extend it exceeds:</span></p>

Any excess financing cost surplus that cannot be deducted can be carried forward to subsequent taxable periods.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>If the company is affiliated with other companies on the basis of Article 11 of the Company Code, the de minimis rule and the taxable EBITDA must be determined on the basis of an ad hoc consolidation whereby the EUR 3 million threshold is proportionally spread over the Belgian group entities. A Royal Decree will need to provide further details about the modalities.  In addition, a transfer of the non-deductible part of the financing cost surplus to other Belgian group entities is possible on the basis of a formal agreement.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The new deduction limitation applies in principle to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">all Belgian companies</span> subject to corporate tax and to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Belgian establishments of foreign companies</span> subject to non-resident tax, with the exception of, among others, financial institutions, companies whose sole activity is the execution of projects of public -private cooperation (PPP) and </span><span>“standalone” companies, i.e. companies that are not part of a group of companies, and satisfy certain other conditions.</span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span><br>
However, the</span><span> old thin-cap scheme continues to apply to:<br>
- Interest paid to tax havens<br>
and<br>
- Interest on intercompany loans taken out before 17 June 2016 provided no fundamental changes have been made since that date. What is considered a fundamental change is not really clear yet.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">This means that for loans received from 17 June 2016, the old thin-cap scheme will continue to apply for interest paid during the fiscal year 2018 and that the new rule will only enter into force from the financial year 2019. </span></p>

Simultaneous employment in multiple EU countries,24/09/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>A while ago, the social security authorities changed their position regarding the applicable internal social security rules in case of simultaneous employment in different countries (administrative decision of December 21, 2017).  </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"">What is it all about? </span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>To determine the applicable social security system within the EU, EU regulation 883/2004 must be consulted.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Basic principle is that one can only be subject to the social security system of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">one country</span>.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In case of simultaneous employment in different countries, the regulation foresees rules to determine which country can levy social security contributions on the total remuneration package.  These rules have not changed.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Once it has been determined which country is competent, it further needs to be determined which scheme is applicable to  the person concerned i.e. the social security scheme for employed persons or the scheme for self-employed persons.  This is where the change takes place.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(54, 95, 145);"">Current and modified position</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In case Belgium is the competent country and can therefore also levy social security contributions on the foreign earned income, it currently follows the qualification of that income in the other country.   In a number of countries (f.e. the Netherlands, France, Denmark, … ), a person exercising a mandate as director, is considered to be an employee.  Therefore, when subject to the Belgian social security scheme, Belgian employee’s social security contributions are due on this income.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In the modified position, Belgium will no longer follow the qualification of the other country but apply its own qualification meaning that the income will be considered to be a self-employed income and social security contributions as a self-employed person will apply.  </span></p>

Hedging of tax on stock options granted,25/06/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When an employer grants stock options to its employees and when these fall within the scope of the stock option law of March 26, 1999, the employee can benefit from a favourable lump sum taxation at the moment of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">grant</span>.  In this respect, the options are deemed to be granted the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">sixtieth day after the date of the offer</span> provided the beneficiary accepts the offer <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">in writing</span> within 60 days. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The taxable benefit in kind amounts to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">18%</span> of the value of the underlying shares if the life of the options, starting from the date of the offer, does not exceed five years, and is increased with <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1%</span> per year or partial year exceeding the initial five-year period.  The rates may be <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">reduced by half</span>  if certain conditions are met, amongst others that the option price must be determined at the moment of the grant.  </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Further when the employee is granted a ‘certain advantage’, he must be taxed on this advantage for the taxable period the advantage becomes certain, provided this is higher than the benefit in kind he was taxed on.  </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The personal income tax paid at grant is also the <em>final tax</em> on the stock options, irrespective of whether the employee exercises the options later on and irrespective of the value of the underlying shares at the moment of exercise.  It is therefore possible that the employee never exercises his options because the value of the shares has decreased or that the employee suffers a loss at exercise in comparison to the tax paid at grant.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"">Hedging of the tax cost</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In practice, some techniques were developed to hedge the tax cost:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The option plan can foresee that the exercise price is decreased in case the value of the underlying shares decreases.  Disadvantage is that the taxation at the reduced rates is not possible as one the conditions for these reduced rates is that the option price must be determined from the start.</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The employer pays a cash bonus to the employee of which the net amount is sufficient to finance the tax.  Disadvantage here is that this technique is very expensive for the employer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"">Ruling commission </span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The ruling commission was recently asked to rule on the following technique: the granter of the stock options pays a cash amount that equals:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>the tax paid at grant in case the beneficiary does not exercise the options or</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>the difference between the tax paid at grant and the capital gain realized at exercise when the capital gain is lower than the tax paid.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The ruling commission’s answer was affirmative.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The cash payment certainly is a ‘certain advantage’ but as long as it is lower than the amount of benefit in kind on which the employee was taxed at grant, no additional taxation occurs.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Further the reduced rates are not lost because the original option price does not change.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Finally the ruling commission also confirmed that the cash payment is a deductible cost for the employer as the granting is linked to the professional activity of the beneficiary and that it does not constitute tax abuse as from an HR point of view a higher acceptance ratio can be achieved. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Example: grant of options with an exercise price of 100, whereas the value of the shares is also 100. If the taxable benefit in kind is calculated at 9%, the tax cost is about 4,5. Suppose the value of the shares is 103 at exercise, then the capital gain is 3. The net cost of 1,5 can be compensated.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"">Conclusion</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The cash payment as hedging technique for the personal income tax paid at the moment of grant of stock options has been positively received by the ruling commission. The hedging clause can even be added to the option plan during the life of the plan.  The employee can however still not be covered in case of termination of the labour agreement leading to the forfeit of the options.</span></p>

VAT deduction and refund...,25/06/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The European Court of Justice ruled in two recent judgments that the VAT deduction respectively the VAT refund in certain cases is still possible, even if the period to exercise the right to deduct or to submit the request for refund has expired.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The <em>'Volkswagen' judgment</em> of March 21, 2018 concerned goods purchased by Volkswagen Germany between 2004 and 2010 in Slovakia for which in first instance no VAT was charged.  In 2010, the Slovak supplier determined that this should have been done and the VAT was still charged. Volkswagen submitted a request for refund to the Slovak tax authorities in 2011. This refund request was (partially) rejected because the legal deadline for the refund had expired for part of the invoices.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In the <em>'Biosafe' judgment</em> of April 12, 2018, Biosafe, a Portuguese supplier, sold goods between 2008 and 2010 to another Portuguese company and had charged a reduced VAT rate on its invoices. Afterwards, this turned out to be incorrect and the Portuguese tax authorities claimed the difference from Biosafe. Biosafe wanted to charge this amount to its customer but this last one refused to pay because the period for exercising the right to deduct had expired.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In both cases, VAT was thus charged too late by the supplier, making it impossible for the buyer to recuperate the VAT.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(0, 112, 192);"">The Court of Justice’s judgement</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In both cases, the Court ruled that ‘<em>it was objectively impossible for the buyer to exercise the right to a refund / right of deduction earlier on the basis of the invoices originally issued, since [...] he did not have documents correcting the original invoices nor did he know that VAT had to be paid or that an extra amount was due</em> '.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The Court emphasizes that:<br>
- the right to deduct / the right to a refund is a fundamental principle which guarantees the neutrality of VAT between VAT taxpayers;<br>
- the exercise of the right to deduct / the right to a refund depends on the fulfillment of material and formal conditions;<br>
- having a valid invoice is one of the formal conditions;<br>
- it is not a problem that the exercise of the VAT deduction respectively refund is subject to an expiration period in order to guarantee legal certainty.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Since in the present case it is only after the expiry period that the customers were aware of the (additional) VAT amount due, they could only exercise their right to deduct / refund at that moment.<br>
</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(0, 112, 192);"">Conclusion</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>On the basis of these judgments, it must therefore also be possible in Belgium to exercise the right to deduct VAT or the right to request a VAT refund after the expiration period in case the material and formal conditions are only fulfilled after this period.</span></p>

European Court of Justice,03/05/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>On April 19, 2018 the European Court of Justice  ruled on the application conditions of the simplified triangulation scheme in the case ‘Firma Hans Bühler KG’ (C-580/16).</p>
<p><strong>Facts</strong></p>
<p>Firma Hans Bühler (‘FHB’), a limited partnership, established and identified for VAT purposes in Germany, operated a production and trading business in that Member State. From October 2012 to March 2013 it was also identified for VAT purposes in Austria, where it planned to set up a permanent establishment.</p>
<p>During that period, FHB used its Austrian VAT identification number exclusively to buy products from suppliers established in Germany and to sell them to a customer established and identified for VAT purposes in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The products were dispatched directly from the German suppliers to the Czech final customer. By setting up its invoice flow in this manner, FHB<br>
received an invoice without VAT and could issue an invoice without VAT, thus reducing the VAT cash flow impact of the transactions.</p>
<p>The Austrian tax authorities challenged the application of the simplified triangulation stating that the said simplification scheme could not be applied as FHB also disposed of a VAT number in the country of dispatch, i.e. Germany.</p>
<p><strong>The Court’s ruling</strong></p>
<p>The Court disagrees with the position taken by the Austrian VAT authorities. The Court ruled that the simplified triangulation scheme cannot be refused to a taxable person on the sole ground that that taxable person is also identified for VAT purposes in the Member State in which the intra-Community dispatch or transport began. Such a refusal would give rise to a significant difference in the manner in which taxable persons are treated and might, without justification, restrict the pursuit of economic activities on the basis of the VAT identification numbers of the taxable person.</p>
<p><strong>Impact for businesses</strong></p>
<p>Although triangulation is a simplification set-out in the EU VAT directive, experience has shown that it has been interpreted and applied differently across the EU Member States. Some EU Member States (such as Austria in this case) denied triangulation where the intermediary is VAT registered in that country; on the basis that the simplification was not relevant as it was designed to negate the need for a VAT registration but one already existed. </p>
<p>The FHB ruling offers taxable persons with multiple VAT numbers the possibility to structure their invoice flows for cross border flows of goods in such a way that the cash flow impact of VAT is minimized and impacted businesses are encouraged to review their arrangements.</p>
<p>Previously a number of EU Member States disallowed this.</p>

Starting up in Belgium,07/07/2017,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>What follows is an overview of some general principles relating to the start up of activities in Belgium by a foreign company without a formal branch in Belgium.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1. General tax issues</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.1. Corporate income tax</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.1.1. Existence of a tax PE in Belgium</span></em></strong></p>
<p>According to article 5 of the double tax treaties Belgium has concluded, a tax permanent establishment generally is defined is a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">fixed</span> place of business wherein  the activities of an enterprise are wholly or partially carried out.  This includes f.e. a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory or workshop,.. (= material PE).</p>
<p>Further also the presence in Belgium of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">employees</span> who are acting on behalf of an enterprise and who have the authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise and habitually exercise that authority, give rise to a permanent establishment (= personal PE).</p>
<p>If however the activities of the foreign enterprise in Belgium are limited to certain activities of a ‘preparatory’ or ‘auxiliary’ nature, no PE arises.   </p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.1.2. Taxation of PE’s in Belgium</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Foreign PE’s are taxed in the corporate non-resident income tax at a rate of 33,99% on their taxable income.  The taxable basis is  determined as for resident companies.</p>
<p>The starting point is the profit as shown in the accounts of the PE.  On this profit, some ‘corrections’ are made so as to arrive at the taxable result f.e. taxation of excessive depreciations and hidden provisions, disallowed expenses like car cost, restaurant and representation costs, income tax, fines, …  On the other hand some deductions can be claimed f.e. prior losses,…</p>
<p>In some cases, it is possible to determine the taxable income on the basis of a cost plus method meaning that the profit of the PE consists of a percentage applied on the operational costs of the PE.  To apply this cost plus method, it is advisable to request an advanced tax ruling from or agreement with the Belgian tax authorities.  This cost plus basis is also corrected with f.e. disallowed expenses. Please note that in Belgium a cost plus method is usually only accepted for companies that merely have a supporting function within a group and to which no specific turnover can be allocated. </p>
<p>Yearly, a non-resident corporate income tax return will need to be filed.</p>
<p>According to article 7 of the double tax treaties Belgium has concluded, in general the profits/costs of a PE must be allocated to the PE as if the PE was an independent and autonomous enterprise performing the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.  Further, the PE must receive an at arm’s length compensation for intra-group services rendered. </p>
<p>In this respect, it is important to determine the functions and risks of the PE as well as to have a transfer pricing documentation.</p>
<p>If a cost plus method is used, it needs to be demonstrated that the percentage used is at arm’s length. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.2. Personal income tax and social security</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.2.1. Tax residence</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Income tax is levied on the worldwide income of Belgian residents and on the Belgian source income of non-residents. Residents are individuals who are domiciled in Belgium or have their seat of fortune in Belgium.  Residency status is determined based on the facts and circumstances. A rebuttable presumption exists that individuals enrolled in the National Register of the Population are resident in Belgium for tax purposes.</p>
<p>Foreign employees that only work temporarily in Belgium and that keep their domicile and seat of fortune abroad, will be taxed in the non-resident income tax.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.2.2. Income obtained in Belgium by non-resident employees</span></em></strong></p>
<p>According to article 15 of the double tax treaties Belgium has concluded, the general rule is that an employee is taxable in his <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">country of residence</span> except when he works in another state.  In the latter case, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">the work state</span> can tax. </p>
<p>If however:</p>
<p>1) the employee’s stay in the work state does not exceed 183 days during any period of 12 months/the calendar year/…. (to verify in each treaty) AND</p>
<p>2) the employee’s salary is paid/born by an employer or a permanent establishment of the employer that is not a resident of the work state</p>
<p>the residence state keeps its taxation rights.</p>
<p>Vice versa if the employee’s stay in the work state exceeds 183 days OR his salary is paid/born by an employer or permanent establishment of the employer in the work state, the work state can tax.</p>
<p>If therefore the foreign company is considered to have a permanent establishment in Belgium and the salary of the foreign employees relating to these Belgian activities will be charged/allocated to the Belgian permanent establishment, the employees will become taxable in Belgium, irrespective of the number of days they actually work in Belgium. In other words, the employees will become taxable in Belgium as from day 1.  As the employees will only work temporarily in Belgium and will keep their domicile abroad, they will be considered as non- residents for Belgian tax purposes.</p>
<p>The foreign company should therefore register as an employer in Belgium and withhold the necessary professional withholding taxes on the employee’s salaries.  To determine if personal deductions can be taken into account, for each employee, it will need to be determined whether he has earned more than 75% of his worldwide income in Belgium or not during the taxable period (on a calendar year basis). To verify this 75% rule, also their foreign earned income, although tax exempted, must be reported in the tax return.</p>
<p>Annually (= calendar year basis) an individual tax return must be filed. </p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.2.3. Social security</span></em></strong></p>
<p>The basic principle is that social security is due in the work state.  In case of temporary posting foreign employees from EU or countries with which Belgium has concluded a social security agreement can however stay subject to their home country social security system provided <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">a form A1</span> is completed.  Please however note that this is only possible for employees that already worked in their home country for the foreign company and not for new hires.</p>
<p>The foreign company  will also need to file a ‘Limosa’ document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.3.Value added tax</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.3.1. Taxable transactions by a non-resident supplier</span></em></strong></p>
<p>When one starts to undertake taxable VAT transactions in Belgium, meaning that the delivery of the goods or the services rendered are located in Belgium, Belgian VAT is due and in principle a Belgian VAT number must be requested.</p>
<p>However, for non-Belgian suppliers, a reverse charge system applies.  This means that no VAT should be mentioned on the outgoing invoice and that it is up to the Belgian customer to declare (and deduct) the Belgian VAT in his own VAT declaration.  This also means that the non-Belgian supplier in principle must not register for VAT purposes.  Please note that the reverse charge system can only apply provided the Belgian customer has a Belgian VAT number and must file periodical VAT returns.   </p>
<p>When the reverse charge system applies, the invoice must mention the reason for the VAT exemption as follows : ‘Exempted from VAT article 51§2,5 Belgian VAT code’. </p>
<p>In any case, also the VAT number of the supplier and the client must be mentioned.</p>
<p>If the non-Belgian supplier that is not registered for VAT purposes in Belgium f.e. purchases goods/services from a Belgian supplier on which Belgian VAT is applicable, the incoming Belgian VAT can be reclaimed on the basis of the 13<sup><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">th</span></sup> EU-directive.</p>
<p>The reverse charge system however does not apply between two direct registrations i.e. two foreign enterprises with a Belgian VAT-number.  This means that if the foreign company works with a foreign subcontractor with a direct VAT registration in Belgium, the invoices must mention Belgian VAT.  The general VAT rate in Belgium is 21%.</p>
<p>In case the foreign supplier cannot apply the reverse charge system, he must request a Belgian VAT-number.  This is the so-called direct VAT registration.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.3.2. VAT compliance (taxpayer’s registration + periodical VAT return)</span></em></strong></p>
<p>When one starts to undertake taxable VAT transactions, one should register for VAT purposes and a VAT number must be requested. </p>
<p>Further the following periodical formalities must be fulfilled:</p>
<p>-          Submitting of a VAT return: if the turnover is lower than EUR 2.500.000 per year, this must be done each quarter; if the turnover is higher than EUR 2.500.000 per year, this must be done each month;  this return has to be sent to the Belgian VAT administration before the twentieth of the quarter/month following on the end of each quarter/month; the VAT due, if any, has to be paid within the same time span; when you are ending up with a VAT amount in your favor on your quarterly VAT return, a reimbursement can be asked for; this reimbursement will be done within 3 months after the VAT declaration has been filed..</p>
<p>-          Quarterly EU declaration: every quarter, the EU-sales have to be reported to the Belgian VAT Administration.</p>
<p>-          Annual VAT listing of Belgian tax payers: every year all sales within Belgian must be reported to the VAT administration; this is the so-called ‘client-listing’.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2. Other formalities</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2.1. Company number</span></strong></p>
<p>In case the foreign company has no formal establishment (branch) in Belgium, it is not required to request a company number.  A company number will however be provided upon the registration as employer or upon the registration of the work (see below).</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2.2. Registration as employer for social security and income tax purposes</span></strong></p>
<p>If the foreign company employs workers in Belgium that are taxable in Belgium, it will need to register as employer with the tax authorities to pay the necessary withholding tax on the salaries.  Therefore a company number will be provided.</p>
<p>If the foreign company employs workers in Belgium that are subject to Belgian social security, it will also need to register as employer for social security purposes. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2.3. Limosa</span></strong></p>
<p>When someone from abroad comes to Belgium for <strong>temporary/partial</strong> employment, the Limosa notification must be done prior to the commencement of the activities in Belgium.  This can be done electronically on <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""limosa""><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #0066cc;"">www.limosa.be</span></a></p>
<p>If the foreign company works with foreign subcontractors, the foreign company also needs to verify whether the subcontractors have fulfilled the Limosa notification for employees employed in Belgium by them.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2.4. Form A1</span></strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, for foreign employees that stay subject to their home country social security system, a form A1 must be completed that they must carry with them.</p>
<p>If the foreign company works with foreign subcontractors, it also needs to verify whether the subcontractors have fulfilled the A1 formalities for employees employed in Belgium by them.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2.5. Labor regulations</span></strong></p>
<p>An employer who posts workers to Belgium is required, for the work performed in Belgium, to observe the working, pay and employment conditions laid down by Belgian law, regulations, administrative or conventional provisions that are subject to penal law.</p>
<p>This amongst other relates to:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;"">-          working hours and rest periods: the labour organisation, that is to say the normal limits of working hours, overtime, work<br>
           on Sundays, nightwork, work on public holidays;</p>

Brexit: indirect taxes update,19/01/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">One of our colleaguas Robert Marchant, Partner and Head of Corporate VAT of Crowe Horwath London, wrote a note on Brexit implications for businesses:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""> <strong>What are the latest developments?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong></strong><br>
International trade arrangements rightly continue to feature prominently in the Brexit discussions and much remains uncertain.<br>
During 2017, the government provided details of their aims for the UK's future customs relationship with the EU which includes a proposal for an interim/transitional period allowing UK businesses to only have to adjust once to a new set of cusstoms/international trade relationships. Further negotiations on a transitional period after Brexit are expected to take place in the first few months of 2018.<br>
<br>
Earlier this week MPs were debating the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill 2017-19 which considers the establishment of a new Customs tariff regime and contains provisions to give flexibility to allow the UK to join other Customs Unions (be it the EU or with other countries) in the future.<br>
Liam Fox, International Trade Secretary, commented that:<br>
""Our priority is to ensure that we continue to benefit from the trade agreements that the EU already has with other countries, and that we maintain the flow of free trade in both directions at the point we leave. Stability now with the flexibility to seize new opportunities in the future is what we seek.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong><br>
What could be the biggest areas of change for cross-border trade?</strong><br>
<br>
I<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mports/exports of goods from the EU</span><br>
The government has previously spoken from its aims of making trade with the EU as 'frictionless' as possible. From a VAT and Customs Duty perspective, if the UK stands apart from the EU, movement of goods between the two would currently fail to be taxed as imports and exports and would result in significant changes to the amount of indirect tax paid and the processes involved.<br>
<br>
* Import VAT would be payable on goods arriving into the UK. Whilst for many import VAT paid may be recoverable, there will be a change in the cash-flow position as import VAT is paid up front and then reclaimed at a later date. This is different to how VAT is currently dealt with on purchases of goods between the UK and the other Member States.<br>
* Customs Duty may be payable when goods are imported into the UK and this is a irrecoverable cost. The amount of Customs Duty payable, if any, will depend on the outcome of the discussions about the UK's membership of the EU Customs Union and/or any other free trade agreements that are reached. Note that also the UK exporters will need to udnerstand whether their products will be subject to import duties on arrivel into other countries.<br>
* In addition, the Institute for Government in its September 2017 study has identified that there could be 180.000 Small and Medium Enterprises that will need to make customs declarations for the first time and that the introduction of customs declarations alone could end up costing traders in the region of £4 billion a year.<br>
* At a practical level, there has been significant concern raised by businesses that there could be delays resulting from customs and border checks when goods enter the UK. Indeed the head of HMRC has previously said that Britain could need up to 5,000 extra staff to handle customs and border checks after Brexit. Similar concerns have also been expressed about UK exporters' goods also being delayed on arrivel in EU Member States.<br>
<br>
One possible solution to the extra checks and likely delays that could arise at the border, is Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status. This is an EU wide concept that has existed for many years and is internationally recognised. AEO status indicates that qualifying businesses' roles in international supply chains are secure, and that they have efficient and compliant customs controls and procedures. AEO registration is voluntary but already brings certain procedural and financial benefits for businesses engaged in international trade. One of the government's proposals at the moment is that AEO status, or a UK equivalent, would reduce the documentary requirements when importing goods into the UK and the clearance process would be quicker as fewer physical inspections would be needed.<br>
<br>
HMRC figures estimate that UK companies with AEO status account for 60% of the UK's imports so there would be a significant number of businesses that would need to gain accreditation in a short period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><br>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Other points</span><br>
While the points above are specific to businesses trading in goods, there may also be areas of change for businesses providing services.<br>
* The Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) VAT registration simplification scheme may no longer be available to UK businesses who make sales of digital services to EU customers and similarly EU businesses could be unable to use MOSS to account for VAT on sales to UK customers.<br>
* This could lead to additional VAT registration obligations and additional complexity in accounting for local VAT.<br>
<br>
For businesses that incur VAT in EU countries where they are not VAT registered.<br>
<br>
* The process for reclaiming foreign VAT will need to change which will impact on the timing of when claims can be made and the recovery process.<br>
<br>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Others:</span><br>
* Over time we would expect a deviation between the UK VAT rules and those of the EU. At the moment, the UK's VAT rules implement EU law, if the UK is no longer bound by EU law the government could amend the scope of existing VAT rates and rules as it sees fit; leading to greater inconsistency for businesses between the UK and EU's VAT rules.<br>
<br>
<strong>Opportunity in the uncertainty?</strong><br>
The UK no longer beint part of the EU Single Market and Customs Union would bring opportunities to make different trading arrangements. In <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.croweclarkwhitehill.co.uk/free-trade-zones-answer-cross-border-trade-post-brexit/"" target=""_blank"" title=""open previous articles""> previous articles</a> we have asked whether Brexit could allow the UK government to re-introduce Free Trade Zones as these commonly can assist in boosting manufacturing and te help promote local businesses. We have previously considered the mechanics of what would be involved, both legally and operationally, in establishing Free Trade Zones in the UK.<br>
<br>
<strong>So what can businesses do now?</strong><br>
For now, assess the parts of your business' activities which may be impacted. It can be difficult for businesses to understand all the types of purchases and sales they make and the physical and legal flows,  but these will all need reviewing to pinpoint the areas that could be impacted. <br>
<br>
For businesses who primarily trade in goods, the likely creation of a customs border between the UK and elsewhere will result in a change to the import/export process and possibly an increase in customs duty and VAT costs. For others, who benefit from specific EU simplifications/reliefs, such as the distance sales and MOSS regimes, there could also be other changes.<br><br>

New reporting requirements for cross border tax strucutures,25/06/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>On May 25, 2018, the Council of the European Union adopted a Directive whereby a new reporting obligation for cross border tax structures was introduced (EU Directive  2018/822).  The notification must be done as from July 1, 2020 but also constructions where the first step of implementation is taken as from June 25, 2018 (i.e. the date of entry into force of the directive) must be reported.  EU Member States have until December 31, 2019 to convert the directive into their national legislation. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: #1f497d;"">Background</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The new reporting obligation must be seen as the extension of the automatic exchange of information within the EU to tackle aggressive cross border tax planning.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: #1f497d;"">Which tax structures must be reported?</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Only <em>cross-border</em> arrangements or a series of arrangements must be reported.  This means that the arrangement must concern more than one Member State or a Member State and a third country.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Further some <em>hallmarks</em> need to be fulfilled.  Some hallmarks trigger the reporting obligation themselves while for others also the main benefit test must be fulfilled.  This last test is met when the main benefit or one of the main benefits is the obtaining of a tax advantage which can reasonably be expected from the arrangement taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances.  </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Examples of the first category are:</span></p>
<ul>

Exit subject to tax clause in tax treaty Belgium - The Netherlands,25/06/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Double tax treaties aim at avoiding double taxation through specific rules on the allocation of taxing rights.   In other words, the tax treaty determines which country can tax certain items of income and how double taxation is avoided.  If the taxation rights are attributed to one country (the ‘host country’), the other (the ‘home country’ or residence country) must generally grant an exemption.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(0, 112, 192);"">Three categories of tax treaties</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Basically there are 3 types of exemption requirements: those that grant an exemption in the home country when the income is</span></p>

</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><em><span>Taxable</span></em><span> means that according to the double tax treaty the income is taxable in the host country irrespective of whether or not and how the host country exercises its taxing rights.  </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><em><span>Taxed</span></em><span> means that the income must be included in the taxable income in the host country where it is subject to its tax regime. This can be an effective taxation but also an exemption following deductions, reductions, ….  </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><em><span>Effectively taxed</span></em><span> means that tax must effectively be paid in the host country.</span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Although article 23 of the double tax treaty uses the term ‘taxed’, the Belgian tax administration has always been of the opinion that In this specific tax treaty, the term ‘taxed’ should be interpreted as ’effectively taxed’.  This was explicitly mentioned in a Circular letter of the Belgian tax administration from 2006.  </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(0, 112, 192);"">Decision of the Supreme Court of January 25, 2018</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The Belgian Supreme Court (Court de Cassation) countered now the interpretation of the Belgian tax administration.  This means that when a Belgian resident receives Dutch source income that can be taxed in the Netherlands according to the tax treaty, Belgium in any case must grant an exemption even when there is actually no tax due in the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span>One example is </span><span>the redemption of a pension built up within the company in The Netherlands by a Belgian tax resident before the date the pension takes effect.  The scope is however broader than this.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Of course, for professional income received by Belgian individuals the exemption with progression remains intact.  This means that notwithstanding the exemption, Belgium can take the exempt income into account to determine the tax rate on the other taxable income in Belgium. </span></p>

The profit premium for employees,17/05/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>The Program Act of December 25, 2017 introduces the 'profit premium for employees' that allows companies to allocate part of their profits to their employees in a simple and flexible way.</p>
<p>The new regulations entered into force on January 1, 2018 and are therefore already applicable to the profits of the financial year 2017 for accounting years closed per September 30, 2017 at the earliest.</p>
<p>The system is open to all companies that are subject to Belgian corporate tax (resident and non-resident).  However, as it is a profit based system, it can only apply to foreign companies with a branch or taxable permanent establishment in Belgium to which profits are allocated that are taxed in Belgium.  Foreign companies without any establishment in Belgium can therefore not apply the system. </p>
<p><strong><em>Definition</em></strong></p>
<p>A profit premium is a monetary bonus that a company (or group of companies) pays out of its profits to all its employees.</p>
<p>There are two types of premiums:<br>
- <em>the identical profit premium</em>: the amount is the same for all employees or corresponds to an equal percentage of their salaries;<br>
- <em>the categorized profit premium</em>: the amount can vary depending on the category to which the employees belong; the allocation key that can be applied must be based on the following objective criteria: seniority, level, function, salary scale, remuneration and education level. The differentiation between the categories may only have a ratio between 1 and 10.</p>
<p><strong><em>Granting of the premium </em></strong></p>
<p>The <em>identical profit premium</em> can be granted by an ordinary or extraordinary general meeting with a simple majority of votes. The minutes of this general meeting must contain a number of mandatory entries. The employer must inform the employees in writing about the decision. This can be done by mail, publication on the intranet or any other written medium.</p>
<p>The <em>categorized profit premium</em> on the other hand can only be introduced by a specific company CLB (collective labor agreement) or via an ‘act of accession’ (for companies without a trade union delegation).</p>
<p><strong><em>Tax and social security treatment </em></strong></p>
<p>For <em>social security</em> purposes, the profit premium is not treated as salary. This means: no ordinary employer or employee contributions. Only a solidarity contribution of 13,07% is due by the employee.</p>
<p>For <em>tax</em> purposes, the premium is only subject to a special levy of 7%. No other income tax is due. For the company, the premium is not deductible as a professional expense.</p>
<p>Consequently, for a gross profit premium of EUR 100, the net amount equals EUR 80,84(100 – 13,07% - 7%), or approximately 80%.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other points of attention</em></strong></p>
<p>The introduction of the premium is solely on the initiative of the employer and does not create acquired rights for the future.</p>
<p>The premium applies only to employees. Company directors are therefore not eligible.</p>
<p>The maximum amount of annual profit that can be granted is 30% of the total gross salary mass.</p>
<p>The premium may not replace wages or other benefits already granted.</p>
<p>Companies that qualify as SME for company law purposes, can organize the granting of the profit premium in the form of an investment savings plan. The premium will then not be paid out effectively but will remain as a subordinated loan in the company on which the latter pays interest. Payment must then be made after a minimum period of 2 years and a maximum of 5 years.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>
<p>The granting of a profit premium is advantageous, not only for the employee but also for the employer and can easily be implemented.</p>

"Do not forget your country-by-country notification before March 31, 2018!",12/03/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
Belgium  has implemented new Transfer Pricing documentation rules for accounting years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. One of the documentation requirements is the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">country-by-country reporting</span>. A country-by-country report must be filed by every multinational group with gross proceeds of at least 750 million on a consolidated basis. In principle it is the ultimate parent company of the group that needs to file the report, but in some cases another group company must be designed. <br>
<br>
According to Belgian tax law, the Belgian group entity must notify the Belgian tax authorities, ultimately the last day of the accounting period concerned, which group entity will file the country-by-country report. For accounting years ended on December 31, 2017, a one-off delay until <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">March 31, 2018</span> is foreseen. Do not forget this!<br>

New optional VAT regime for immovable rent,20/09/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""color: black;"">Recently the Belgian government announced that an optional VAT regime to tax the immovable rent for professional purposes will be introduced as of 1 January 2019. Previously, an immovable rent was in any case VAT exempted, without the right to deduct VAT (e.g. on construction costs, maintenance costs, etc.).</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""color: black;"">On 2 August 2018, the draft law and explanatory notes were published by the Federal Chamber of Representatives providing further detail on the application conditions for the new optional VAT regime.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(46, 116, 181);"">Scope of application of the new optional VAT regime</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""color: black;"">The application of the optional VAT regime is subjected to material as well as formal conditions. As material conditions, the (draft) legislation stipulates that:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""color: black;"">The rent should concern a building or parts of a building which can be operated separately (with or without adjacent grounds);</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""color: black;"">The immovable property is rented to a VAT taxable person that uses the immovable property for the purpose of his (VAT taxable) economic activity.<span style=""color: black;""><br>
<span style=""color: black;""></span></span></span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""color: black;"">The optional VAT regime only applies for rental agreements relating to immovable property that is new or thoroughly renovated. The legislator has opted to allow the optional VAT regime in principle only for immovable property on which VAT has become chargeable as of 1 October 2018. Buildings for which VAT became due before 1 October 2018 are thus out of scope of the optional VAT regime.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""color: black;"">Furthermore, the optional VAT regime is subject to a formal condition. More specifically, it is required that both the renter as well as the tenant must mutually agree to apply the optional VAT regime. </span></p>
<p style=""background: white; margin: 6.75pt 0cm;""><span style=""color: black;"">As a counter to the option to tax and deduct the VAT incurred, the VAT revision period for the immovable property that is rented under the optional VAT regime will be extended from 15 years to 25 years. </span></p>
<p style=""background: white; margin: 6.75pt 0cm;""><span style=""color: black;"">Needless to say that the extended VAT revision period is a drawback of the new optional VAT regime. Therefore, a VAT taxable person should still consider possible alternatives to the optional VAT regime such as a VAT group, immovable lease, business center, etc.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(46, 116, 181);"">Short term lease </span></em></strong></p>
<span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">In addition to the new legislative initiative for professional real estate, the Belgian legislator imposes a mandatory application of VAT on the short term rental of real estate (up to 6 months) in both B2B and B2C relations. Exceptions will, however, be introduced for immovable property used for private use and for socio-cultural activities. This measure also applies to existing buildings (e.g. existing party halls, meeting rooms, seminar and congress rooms, ...)<br>

Ruling commission limits the use of listed warrants and options on bevek/sicav,15/02/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">In view of the high (para) tax burden on cash incentives in Belgium, both for employees and employers, often less expensive alternatives are sought. One of these concerns the granting of stock options on Bevek/sicav or listed warrants.<br></span><br style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;"">The technique is simple: an employer buys listed warrants or issues options on bevek/sicav. These are then offered free of charge and on a discretionary basis to the employees, who must accept within a certain period. The employee can then proceed to sell the warrants or exercise the option.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span><br style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Tax treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Neither the sale of the warrants by the employee nor the exercise of the options is subject to tax.</span><br style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<br style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;"">The taxable moment is however situated the sixtieth day after the offer. At that moment the employee is taxed on a benefit in kind. This benefit is then equal to the closing price of the day prior to the offer for listed warrants/options or, in case of non-listed stock options and if certain conditions are met, a percentage of the value of the underlying shares. This percentage is 18% + 1% per year above the fifth year when the options have a longer term than 5 years. The tax burden for the employee is 50%.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span><br style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Parafiscal treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">The taxable benefit is not subject to social security contributors (employers or employees). Possibly, social contributions as independent are due.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span><br style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Decisions ruling commission</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">In the past, the ruling commission issued positive rulings when there was no disproportion between the amount of the cash remuneration and the amount of the warrants and stock options granted.</span><br style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;"">In two recent rulings, the ruling commission has now defined the disproportionate character. In particular, the part of the remuneration and the amount of the warrants and stock options on sicav/bevek may not exceed 20% of the total cash remuneration. This is the gross salary including holiday allowance and thirteenth month as well as the variable salary. This limitation applies to awards for services as from 1 January 2018. For warrants and stock options relating to services performed before 1 January 2018, the old proportionality condition remains valid without being quantified.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span><br style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">It is therefore recommended to review your existing remuneration technique and make adjustments, if necessary.</span></p>
