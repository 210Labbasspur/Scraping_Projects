Deduction limitations of recharged costs: an update,05/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>A number of costs, although professional, are only partly or even not at all tax deductible: e.g. costs of cars (percentage depending among others on CO2), restaurant (69%), reception and business gifts (50%), clothing (not deductible). If these costs are passed on, there is a risk of double taxation: on the one hand to the party who bears the costs in the first place and on the other hand to its customer.</p>
<p>We look first at the current arrangements and then at the legislative proposal.</p>
<h2>Recharged car expenses</h2>
<p>Article 66, §2, paragraph 4 WIB1992 confirms that for car expenses no deduction limitation applies for costs recharged to third parties, provided that these costs are explicitly and separately mentioned on the invoice. The tax deduction limitation of the (recharged) car expenses does not apply to the taxpayer who incurred the expense and recharges it, but to the third party to whom the expenses are recharged. </p>
<p>However, there are conditions for the deduction restriction not to be applied to the person who recharges:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be car costs that are recharged to third parties for the same amount and by means of an explicit and separate statement on the invoice;</li>
<li>The CO2 emissions and fuel used must be included in the invoice, so that the third party to whom the car costs are re-invoiced is able to apply the correct tax deduction limitation with respect to the costs (recharged) to him.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recharged restaurant and reception costs </h2>
<p>Here the Administration accepts that the deduction limitation must not be applied to costs recharged to ""a third party who is also subject to the deduction limitation and in a manner that leaves no doubt as to the precise scope of the transaction."" Unlike the legal regulation of recharged car expenses, restaurant and reception expenses do require that the third party be taxable in Belgium.</p>
<h2>Legislative proposal on recharged costs </h2>
<p>It is proposed to apply the same rules to recharged restaurant, reception, business gifts, clothing, hunting and fishing expenses as those for recharged car expenses. The deduction limitation will then no longer apply if the costs are recharged to third parties, provided that these costs are explicitly and separately stated on the invoice.</p>
<h2>Legislative proposal on the price of trade goods </h2>
<p>It is also proposed to expressly provide that the price of trade goods (within the meaning of the accounting legislation) is a professional expense that is not subject to the deduction restrictions. We are thinking here of expenses booked in a 60 account. If the costs are entered in the accounts as trade goods in accordance with the accounting legislation, the deduction limitation would therefore not apply and there is also no need to mention these goods separately on the invoice.</p>
<p>This rule is particularly relevant for event organizers, but its scope can be much broader.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This bill, which would apply as of tax year 2022, would allow the deduction limits to no longer be applied to the service provider in a number of cases. We will keep you posted on the further evolution. </p>

Student workers: everything you need to know,05/05/2023,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Student workers are <strong>an important part</strong> <strong>of the Belgian labour market</strong>. Every year, thousands of students work in <strong>various industries</strong>, such as retail and hospitality. With summer approaching, the number of students working will also increase again. Before employing students, it is essential to be aware of the relevant regulations and make the proper preparations. In this blog, we would like to give you the key points to consider when planning to employ students:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Age and study requirements</span></strong><span>: Working students in Belgium must be at least 15 years old. They must be enrolled as a student at an accredited educational institution, such as a high school, college or university. It is important to check students' proof of enrolment and make sure they meet these requirements.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2. </strong></span><strong>Working conditions and hours</strong>: As an employer, it is important to be aware of the specific working conditions and hours that apply to student workers. In Belgium, working students are allowed to work up to 600 hours per calendar year at a solidarity contribution (social security) on their gross pay of 2.71% for the student and 5.43% for the employer. In addition, no withholding tax is deducted from a student worker's pay. When a student works more than 600 hours, in principle, the normal rules that apply to any other employee in your company will apply. Thus, you will pay a higher employer's contribution on their gross pay, the social security contribution of 13.07% will apply, and the rules regarding withholding tax will apply.</p>
<p><span><strong>3. </strong></span><strong>Work on Sundays and public holidays:</strong> In principle, employees under 18 years of age may not be employed on Sundays or public holidays or work between 8pm and 6am. However, exceptions to this have been defined for certain sectors, such as the hospitality industry. For example, in the hospitality industry, young people under 18 are allowed to work on Sundays and public holidays every two weeks if they receive an extra day of rest in exchange. In the case of night work by a young person under the age of 18, there must be a continuous rest period of 12 hours between the end of the working day and the resumption of work the following day.</p>
<p><span><strong>4. </strong></span><strong>Employment contract:</strong> Student workers are required to have a written employment contract. This is regardless of the length of the employment contract. This contract must contain well-defined inforation, such as the duration of the contract, salary, working hours and job description. It is important to note that the first 3 working days of the contract are always considered probationary, even if there is no specific probation clause in the contract. During this period, both the employer and the student may terminate the contract without notice or compensation.</p>
<p><span><strong>5. </strong></span><strong>DIMONA declaration:</strong> As with other employees, it is required by law to file a DIMONA declaration before the start of employment. In the event of a late declaration for a student, the student cannot work as a student worker for the remainder of the quarter or until the end of the employment contract and is automatically treated as a regular employee by the NSSO.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>There are some situations in which a student is not eligible to work as a student worker:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Work experience of more than 12 months</span></strong><span>: If a student has already worked continuously with the same employer for more than 12 months, they can no longer work as a student worker with the same employer. However, they can still work as a student worker with another employer.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Mandatory school attendance</span></strong><span>: Working students may not have work hours at times when they are required to be present at school on a mandatory basis. This is to ensure that students have sufficient time for their studies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>School leavers after summer vacation</span></strong><span>: After 30 September, school leavers can no longer work as student workers. This gives them the opportunity to focus on finding full-time employment or further studies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Receiving unemployment benefits</span></strong><span>: If a student is receiving unemployment benefits, they cannot work as a student worker. This is because the student is considered actively seeking full-time employment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unpaid internships as part of a programme of study</strong><span>: If a student takes an unpaid internship as a required part of their programme of study, they cannot receive a student contract for this internship. In that case, different rules and guidelines apply to the internship.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Reduced curriculum or night school</span></strong><span>: If a student attends only night school or education with a reduced curriculum, restrictions or prohibitions may apply to working as a student worker. These rules may vary depending on the specific situation and educational institution.</span></li>
</ul>

Electronic invoicing,19/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Following the postponement of the introduction of mandatory <strong>electronic invoicing</strong> at the European level as part of the <strong>ViDA reforms</strong>, Belgium is implementing general mandatory electronic <strong>invoicing for B2B transactions from 1 January 2026</strong>. The move to mandatory electronic invoicing is important to reduce the VAT gap, the difference between what the government should receive in VAT revenue and what the government actually receives, and to further a reduction in the administrative burden for businesses.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>

VAT and immovable rent: administrative guidelines published,01/04/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>Since the publication and entry into force of the Law of 14 October 2018 amending the Belgian VAT Code and implementing the new optional VAT regime for immovable rent, administrative guidelines accompanying this new legislation were expected to be published.</p>
<p>In addition to the administrative notice of 9 January 2019 on the reimbursement of historical VAT as a result of the optional taxation of immovable rental, the VAT administration published a new Circular letter on 21 March 2019 (Circular letter 2019/C/25).</p>
<p><strong>Administrative notice: Reimbursement of historical VAT  as a result of the optional taxation of immovable rental.</strong></p>
<p>The new VAT option for immovable rental allows for (historical) input VAT to be deducted. As a result, for VAT that became chargeable before 1 January 2019, which in the past was often not or not fully deductable, a refund can be claimed going forward.</p>
<p>To mitigate the budgetary impact of the refund of historical VAT, the VAT authorities foresee a staggered refund. More specifically, the notice stipulates that the amount of the historically refundable VAT must be set off against the amount of VAT due as it arises periodically in the VAT returns (box 71) as from the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>If after this settlement an amount of historical VAT is still eligible for refund, this VAT credit is transferred to the following VAT reporting periods until no further VAT credit remains.<span style=""color: red;""> </span></p>
<p>Please note however that the amount of the VAT credit, that cannot be settled in the first eleven monthly VAT returns or the first three quarterly VAT returns of the year 2019, can be deducted (in full) in the monthly VAT return of December 2019 or the VAT return for the fourth quarter of the year 2019, regardless of the end result of these declarations.</p>
<p>Finally, and not without importance, the administration states that the VAT taxable person who wishes to reclaim historical VAT must provide the competent VAT office with an inventory of the goods and services on which he wants to reclaim historical VAT.</p>
<p><strong>Circular Letter 2019/C/25: FAQ regarding the application of the new legislation in the field of immovable rent</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned administrative notice, the VAT administration has published a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on 21 March 2019.</p>
<p>The FAQ provides an insight into the practical application of the VAT option for immovable rent. Practical guidance is given on: which type of immovable property is eligible for the new option, whether parts of immovable property can be subject to the VAT option for immovable rent, whether vacancy has an impact on the initial VAT deducted, etc. The published administrative guidelines are to a large extent in line with what became previously known through the parliamentary documents and author texts.</p>
<p>In addition, the FAQ provides guidance on the application of the mandatory application of VAT for short-term (max. six-month duration) immovable rent (which could previously also be considered VAT exempt). Practical guidance is given on: which type of short-term immovable rent is meant, how the six-month period should be calculated (e.g. in the case of successive contracts), etc.</p>
<p>Finally, the FAQ provides an explanation of the new administrative guidelines regarding the rental of storage facilities. The published administrative guidelines are on these topics also in line with what became previously known through the parliamentary documents and author texts.</p>

VAT in the digital age (ViDA),17/07/2023,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<span style=""line-height: 120%;""><strong></strong></span>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The current<strong> EU VAT system for intra-EU trade</strong> is almost 30 years old and, despite some recent improvements, has not kept pace with technological advances, the digital economy, changes in business models, or globalisation. On 8 December 2022, the European Commission proposed a series of measures to modernize the EU's Value-Added Tax (VAT) system. The proposal is aimed to make VAT work better for businesses, more resilient to fraud by embracing and promoting digitalization.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The VAT in the Digital Age package takes full advantage of technological and digital advances to deliver on an updated VAT system. In a nutshell, the European Commission has put forward proposals for:</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>1. A move to real-time digital reporting based on e-invoicing for businesses that operate cross-border in the EU and a harmonised framework for domestic transactions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The new system introduces <strong>real-time, transaction-based digital reporting</strong> for VAT purposes, based on e-invoicing. Once operational, the system will give Member States valuable information they need to <strong>control cross-border transactions and step up the fight against cross-border VAT fraud</strong>, while reducing administrative and compliance costs for businesses. To make the best use of this data for VAT control and anti-fraud purposes, Member States will also be equipped with the appropriate administrative cooperation tools.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>2. Updated VAT rules for passenger transport and short-term accommodation platforms</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under the new rules, platform economy operators themselves will be deemed <strong>responsible for collecting VAT when service providers</strong> do not (because they are, for example, a small business not usually required to register for VAT) and for remitting this VAT to tax authorities. This, together with other clarifications, will ensure a uniform approach across all Member States and contribute to a more level playing field between online and traditional accommodation and transport services. It also makes life simpler for SMEs using the platforms as they will no longer need to understand and ensure compliance with VAT rules, often in other Member States.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>3. The introduction of a single VAT registration across the EU</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Building on the already existing ‘One Stop Shop' model for e-commerce traders, the EU Commission’s proposal will further reduce the circumstances in which businesses that want to sell to consumers in more than one Member State have to register in other Member States. With this reform, traders who operate cross-border can opt to register in only one Member State for their sales to consumers across the EU and for their transfers of goods for storage in other Member States. After registration in <strong>one Member State</strong>, they will then be able to fulfil their VAT obligations via a single online portal and interact solely with the tax administration of that Member State in one language, even though their sales are EU-wide. Smaller businesses, in particular those who want to scale-up, will benefit from the much simpler administration introduced by the new rules. The proposal also makes it mandatory for online platforms to register for the Import One Stop Shop which will further improve VAT compliance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Where are we now?</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The ViDA  proposals are likely to have a big impact for many businesses in the European Union. Currently, the ViDA is going through the consultation and legislative process at the EU level. In this regard, the EU Finance Ministers broadly agree with ViDA proposals. However, a call to delay the proposed timetable on e-invoicing and to further consider the rules on platform reforms was raised. Some EU Member States have also raised questions on the costs of the required IT investment. In July 2023, the EU Parliament called for 2-year delay on the measures.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>A final agreement and vote on the measures, their implementation and the timeline thereof is anticipate for the <strong>ECOFIN meeting of 17 October 2023</strong>. If the current timetable for implementation is kept and the first measure being implemented as of 1 January 2024, this will mean that businesses in the EU will have little time to adapt to the new rules. Although some delays and/or transitory measures are likely, businesses should prepare for the upcoming changes under ViDA.</span></p>

VAT deduction and refund...,25/06/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The European Court of Justice ruled in two recent judgments that the VAT deduction respectively the VAT refund in certain cases is still possible, even if the period to exercise the right to deduct or to submit the request for refund has expired.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The <em>'Volkswagen' judgment</em> of March 21, 2018 concerned goods purchased by Volkswagen Germany between 2004 and 2010 in Slovakia for which in first instance no VAT was charged.  In 2010, the Slovak supplier determined that this should have been done and the VAT was still charged. Volkswagen submitted a request for refund to the Slovak tax authorities in 2011. This refund request was (partially) rejected because the legal deadline for the refund had expired for part of the invoices.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In the <em>'Biosafe' judgment</em> of April 12, 2018, Biosafe, a Portuguese supplier, sold goods between 2008 and 2010 to another Portuguese company and had charged a reduced VAT rate on its invoices. Afterwards, this turned out to be incorrect and the Portuguese tax authorities claimed the difference from Biosafe. Biosafe wanted to charge this amount to its customer but this last one refused to pay because the period for exercising the right to deduct had expired.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In both cases, VAT was thus charged too late by the supplier, making it impossible for the buyer to recuperate the VAT.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(0, 112, 192);"">The Court of Justice’s judgement</span></em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>In both cases, the Court ruled that ‘<em>it was objectively impossible for the buyer to exercise the right to a refund / right of deduction earlier on the basis of the invoices originally issued, since [...] he did not have documents correcting the original invoices nor did he know that VAT had to be paid or that an extra amount was due</em> '.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>The Court emphasizes that:<br>
- the right to deduct / the right to a refund is a fundamental principle which guarantees the neutrality of VAT between VAT taxpayers;<br>
- the exercise of the right to deduct / the right to a refund depends on the fulfillment of material and formal conditions;<br>
- having a valid invoice is one of the formal conditions;<br>
- it is not a problem that the exercise of the VAT deduction respectively refund is subject to an expiration period in order to guarantee legal certainty.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Since in the present case it is only after the expiry period that the customers were aware of the (additional) VAT amount due, they could only exercise their right to deduct / refund at that moment.<br>
</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(0, 112, 192);"">Conclusion</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>On the basis of these judgments, it must therefore also be possible in Belgium to exercise the right to deduct VAT or the right to request a VAT refund after the expiration period in case the material and formal conditions are only fulfilled after this period.</span></p>

A novelty for Belgium - Tax consolidation,05/12/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>For the first time in Belgian tax history, Belgium introduces tax consolidation, as from assessment year 2020, i.e. financial years starting 1 January 2019 or later.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Group contribution</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>The Belgian system will not require establishing consolidated accounts as it uses a ‘group contribution’ system: Belgian profitable entities (companies or PE’s of EEA companies) will be able to transfer (part of their) taxable profits (i.e. to make a ‘group contribution’) to a Belgian loss making affiliated entity (company or PE of EEA companies). The loss making entity can set-off the group contribution received against its current year tax losses and the profitable entity gets a tax-deduction for the ‘group contribution’ made.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Requirements?</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>- Companies should be affiliated =</span></p>
<p><span>- parent and subsidiary companies with direct participation of at least 90%</span></p>
<p><span></span>- sister companies with the same parent (in Belgium or EEA) where the parent has a direct participation of at least 90% in the sisters</p>
<p><span>- for an uninterrupted period of 5 years, and</span></p>
<p><span>- they should per taxable period conclude a ‘group contribution’ agreement that must meet certain requirements;</span></p>
<p><span>- the (profitable) entity will have to financially compensate the (loss-making) entity for the tax benefit resulting from the tax-deductible ‘group contribution’ made;  </span>this compensation is non-deductible for the paying company and exempt for the receiving company.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""color: #2e74b5;"">Take-away</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Belgian group companies with a loss making entity should as soon as possible check whether they meet the requirements for tax consolidation!</span></p>

Some fiscal points of attention at the year-end closing,23/12/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>With the end of the year in sight, it is useful to consider a number of measures that could have an impact on the tax position of companies.</p>
<p>Below we list a number of tax points of attention.</p>
<h2>Mobilization of reserves</h2>
<p>For tax years 2021 and 2022 (financial years 2020 and 2021), the possibility has been foreseen to transfer certain old tax-free reserves to the taxed reserves and to have them taxed at a favourable rate of 15% or 10% if certain investments were made during the financial year.</p>
<p>Tax year 2022 is therefore the last time that this favourable regime can be used. However keep in mind that this transfer to the taxable reserves leads to effective tax. The taxable base cannot be offset with any deductions, nor can any imputations be done.</p>
<h2>Reconstruction reserve</h2>
<p>In order to absorb the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the equity of companies and to restore their solvency, the reconstruction reserve was introduced as one of the measures to give companies more financial breathing space. </p>
<p>The reconstruction reserve offers companies the possibility, under certain conditions, to create an exempt reserve in tax years 2022, 2023 and/or 2024 up to the amount of the accounting loss they incurred in the financial year ending in 2020 (in some cases, for the financial year ending in 2021) with an absolute maximum of 20 million euros. For each taxable period, however, the creation is limited to the taxable reserved profit before creation of the construction reserve.</p>
<p>Tax year 2022 is the first year in which the reconstruction reserve can be built up. Maintaining the exemption requires that no distributions are made from equity and that the employment level is maintained at the same level. </p>

Tax-friendly remuneration: the corona premium,05/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>In the context of the wage agreement in which a maximum wage increase of 0.4% above the obligatory indexation was agreed, it was further decided that this may still be supplemented with a 'corona premium'.</p>
<h2>The corona premium for employees</h2>
<p>The corona premium can be granted by employers to their employees from 1 August 2021 to 31 December 2021. This will be paid in the form of cheques. The cheques will be valid until December 31, 2022. </p>
<p>The granting must be contained in a collective labour agreement concluded at sectoral or company level.  In the absence of a trade union delegation, the granting may also be done in a written individual agreement. The maximum amount that can be granted is EUR 500,00.  It can be spent in the catering, sports and cultural sector as well as in retail stores that have been closed for at least a month.</p>
<p>For social security purposes, the corona premium is not regarded as salary, so that no ordinary social security contributions are due (neither employer nor employee contributions). There is only a special employer's contribution of 16.5%.</p>
<p>For tax purposes, the premium as well as the special employer's contribution can be deducted as professional expense for employers. For employees, it is an exempt social benefit. Therefore, no tax is due. </p>
<h2>The corona premium for self-employed persons </h2>
<p>Self-employed persons can also qualify for a premium if they have received a ‘bridging right’ for 6 months in the period from 1 October 2020 to 30 April 2021. The gross amount is EUR 598,80 and is paid in cash. It can be spent wherever the individual wants. The premium is taxable separately at 16.5%, so that it amounts to EUR 500,00 net. Both companies’ directors as other self-employed persons as well as coworking spouses can benefit from the premium.  Self-employed persons in a secondary occupation are also eligible, provided that the social contributions they pay are as high as those of a self-employed person in main occupation. The premium was automatically paid by the social security funds on 30 September 2021 at the latest, but does not accrue social rights.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The corona premium gives employers an additional opportunity to provide their employees with an extra remuneration in a tax-friendly manner. </p>

Lump sum valuation benefit in kind electricity and heating,02/05/2022,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>The benefit in kind for the free provision of electricity and heating has been valued on a lump sum basis for many years. This has partly come to an end as from 1 January 2022.</p>
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Existing rules</strong>  </p>
<p>When an employer or company provides electricity and heating to its employees or directors free of charge, a taxable benefit in kind must be taken into account. This taxable benefit is estimated on a lump sum basis.</p>
<p>For the income year 2022 the following amounts apply: </p>
<p><strong><br>
For electricity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Directors and other executive staff:<span> </span>EUR 1.060,00</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Other employees:<span> </span>EUR 480,00</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>For heating:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Directors and other executive staff:<span> </span>EUR 2.130,00</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Other employees:<span> </span>EUR 960,00</li>
</ul>
<p>When the employee or director pays a personal contribution, this may be deducted from the amount of the taxable benefit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>New rules   </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style=""text-align: justify;"">The amounts remain unchanged, although the lump sum valuation will only apply when the person providing the free electricity and heating also provides free housing.  In other words, the benefit for the free provision of heating and/or electricity will only be estimated on a lump sum basis provided that heating and/or electricity is used in a property that the same employer or company puts at the disposal of the employee or director. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If this is not the case, the benefit for the free electricity and heating must be valued at its actual <strong>value</strong>. A personal contribution may still be deducted.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The regulation was amended after a ruling was issued confirming that the lump sum valuation could also apply within the context of so-called cafeteria plans whereby employees are offered the possibility, as part of such a plan, to subscribe to the supply of heating and/or electricity up to a certain budget and whereby they are then only taxed on the lump sum amounts. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><br>
Pain points of the new regulation  </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The question arises whether this new regulation passes the test of the principle of equal treatment.  Indeed, from now on, a distinction is made depending on whether or not the employee or director also receives free housing.  A distinction is only justified if it is based on an objective criterion and is reasonably justified.  This justification is currently lacking. In addition, practical problems arise in connection with determining the actual value.  If there is no separate counter, no distinction can be made between private and business consumption.   And what if there are solar panels?  At the moment it is unclear whether the cost of these must also be included and to what extent. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The adjustment of the lump sum valuation of the benefit for electricity and heating not only leads to probable inequality but also to legal uncertainty and probably also numerous discussions with the tax authorities. Further clarification/fine tuning is therefore necessary. </p>

Changed reporting obligation regarding costs proper to the employer,05/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>Traditionally, costs proper to the employer are defined as costs incurred by an employee or company director in the course of their professional activity, but which are for the account of the employer. These costs are often 'advanced' by the employee or the director and subsequently reimbursed via 'expense reports'. However, for the sake of convenience, the lump sum allowances foreseen by the tax authorities and the social security authorities are often used.</p>
<p>In order not to jeopardize the (limited or unlimited) deductibility of these costs in the name of the employer and/or not to run the risk that these costs would be subject to the special assessment as secret commissions, employers better report both the lump sum reimbursed costs as the costs reimbursed on the basis of supporting documents on the individual pay slips 281.10 of the employees respectively 218.20 of the directors. </p>
<h2>Actual reporting obligation</h2>
<p>Currently, the following statements must be mentioned on the forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it concerns a lump sum reimbursement determined in accordance with serious standards: YES, serious standards</li>
<li>If it concerns a lump sum reimbursement that has not been determined in accordance with serious standards: the amount of the reimbursed costs</li>
<li>If it concerns a reimbursement that  has been determined on the basis of supporting documents: YES, supporting documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>If different types of expense allowances are granted, a combination of the different statements should be mentioned.</p>
<p>Future reporting obligation</p>
<p>As from January 1, 2022, for reimbursement of costs based on supporting documents, the amount must also be mentioned on the salary form. This must be done in the 'miscellaneous information' box.
Failure to do so will result in an administrative sanction. However, the non-deductibility of the costs is not jeopardized and the assessment as a secret commission is not immediately threatening.<br>
<em>Note that it was already provided that from that same date the actual amount paid as home-work allowances must also be included on the forms.</em></p>
<h2>Ratio legis</h2>
<p>The introduction of this stricter reporting obligation should allow the tax authorities to better verify cost reimbursements. On the one hand, they want to limit the double reimbursement of costs on the one hand on a lump sum basis and on the other hand on the basis of supporting documents. On the other hand, they want to avoid that that employees deduct certain costs as actual professional  xpenses while they already receive a lump sum allowance from their employer for the same costs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The additional reporting obligation once again increases the administrative burden on employers.</p>
And although this will only take effect for payments from January 1, 2022 and must therefore only be included in the forms that must be submitted before March 1, 2023, employers do well to already think now about a system to ensure that this reporting runs smoothly. It is also a good opportunity to take a critical look at the actual full package of cost reimbursements.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background: white; color: black;"">Tax prepayments are important for both sole traders and corporations to maintain financial stability and avoid unnecessary tax increases.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>Tax increase for insufficient prepayments</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>For companies</span></strong></p>

<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> </strong>There will be no increase for the first three financial years of a small company (Art. 1:24, §1 to 6 CCA).  However, prepayment in this particular case does allow you to account for future liabilities, which can be beneficial for your available cash.

</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>For sole traders</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Sole traders will also face tax increases if they fail to make sufficient prepayments on time.  The multiplier rate will increase <strong>in personal income tax from 4.5% (income year 2023) to 9% (income year 2024, assessment year 2025).</strong>  Which is a significant increase for these taxpayers.</li>

</span></strong>Did you fail to achieve the expected results and prepaid too much as a result? Will prepayments made then be lost or do you have to wait for the tax bill to recover these funds?  No, you can make a change of destination of your prepayments until 31 March of the following year (when the financial year equals the calendar year). You can carry forward (possibly partially) the prepayment to next financial year and/or claim an early refund. A combination of both, transfer and repay, is also possible.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>TIP: Maintain your financial reserves and/or cash flow for your investments or future projects</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span></span></strong>Finance your prepayments with a loan from your financial institution.  This way, you will not only avoid unnecessary tax increases, but also optimise your reserves and available cash flow.  You can use these funds for investments, projects, and contingencies. These loans are available at a cheaper rate, where you spread repayment over 12 months.  The interest paid is also a tax-deductible expense.To benefit from the 12% tax benefit, it is advisable to submit your application to the bank before the end of March.</p>

<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">As you may have already heard, a number of relaxations will again take effect as of Wednesday 9th of June 2021.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;""> </p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">These relaxations are part of the first step in the ""Summer Plan"". </p>
<p style=""color: #000000; margin: 0cm;"">We have listed the most important changes for you.</p>
<h2> Return to the workplace</h2>
<p>
Since the previous consultation committee, it has been permitted for employers to organize <strong>'return moments'</strong>. In concrete terms, these are moments when employees who have been doing <strong>compulsory telework</strong> in the past few months can come back to the office. Note that teleworking is still compulsory until the <strong>1<sup>st</sup> of July 2021</strong>.</p>
<p>
These return moments do have a number of mandatory conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>These moments are allowed for a maximum of 20% of the employees at the same time and for one day a week.
</li>
<li> In companies with less than 10 employees, a maximum of 5 employees may be present at the same time. However, testing of employees is strongly recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>
Employees returning from holidays abroad </h2>
<p>The rules below only apply as of the 1st of July 2021. Until that date, the current measures remain in force. </p>
<p>Employees can travel freely within the European Union if they have a <strong>digital corona certificate</strong>. 
This certificate is proof that someone has been vaccinated against corona, has tested negative, or has recently recovered from corona. <strong>The Passenger Location Form</strong> (PLF) is still compulsory, but the distinction between private and business travel has been removed. Therefore, it is no longer mandatory for business trips to complete the Business Travel Brad tool, but the PLF must be completed.</p>
<p>The quarantine rules regarding travel will also be adjusted:</p>
<ul>
<li>When your employees return from a green or orange zone, they are not required to go into quarantine or be tested. </li>
<li>When your employees return from a red zone, they do not have to go into quarantine after returning, provided they have a digital corona certificate or a recent PCR test.
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Foreign Workers</h2>
<p>If, as an employer, you employ foreign workers, the same rules apply. However, other rules apply if your employees come from countries that are not members of the European Union:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign employees who come from outside the European Union must be fully vaccinated (+ 2 weeks) with a vaccine recognized by Europe and take a PCR test on the day of arrival. If the test is negative, this employee does not have to go into quarantine.</li>
<li>An entry ban applies to foreign employees who come from or have stayed in a very high-risk area (""Variants of concern""). Exceptions are made for essential travel by transport personnel and diplomats. They must undergo a 10-day mandatory quarantine with a PCR test on day 1 and day 7. The quarantine may only be interrupted for an essential reason.
</li>
</ul>

Mobility allowance versus mobility budget: what’s in a name?,01/04/2019,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>In the context of striving for sustainable mobility, a number of measures have been introduced by the government that should be an attractive alternative to the company car.</span></p>
<p><span>The first concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility allowance</span> that was introduced as per January 1, 2018. This allowance offers employees the opportunity to trade in their company car for a monthly cash allowance = cash for car.</span></p>
<p><span>The second concerns the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mobility budget</span> that is applicable as from March 1, 2019. The mobility budget means that an employee can trade in his company car up to a certain amount for a more environmentally friendly and cheaper car. The rest of the budget can then be spent on sustainable means of transport such as a subscription to public transport, a car sharing system, a bicycle allowance, etc. Any balance will be paid out in cash at the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that both measures apply, it is time for a comparative overview.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Comparison of both measures</em></strong></p>
<p><span>The award conditions are identical, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The employer must have made a company car available to at least one employee for at least 36 months.  Start-up companies that have not been in operation for 36 months can still offer the systems if they already have company cars in their pay packages for 12 months.</span></li>
<li><span>The employee must have been entitled to a company car for at least 12 months in the 36 months prior to the application, of which at least 3 months must be uninterrupted before the application.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>However, they do not apply when an employee is recruited or promoted or in case of a function change before 1 March 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, neither of these measures are mandatory: the employer is not required to offer them and the employee is not required to accept them!</span></p>
<p><span>The main differences are in the following areas:</span></p>

Tax deductibility of rental charges,19/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span>From the assessment year 2024 onwards</span></strong><span>, a sole proprietorship or company can no longer deduct, for tax purposes, the rent paid for real estate used for professional purposes or the fee for the use of property rights (such as ground lease, surface rights, usufruct and easements) without completing additional formalities. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>From now on, you must attach a <strong>form 270 MLH per property,</strong> to your income tax return in order to deduct the rent or fee paid for tax purposes.  The form should communicate the following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>the location of the property</span></li>
<li><span> </span>the charge paid, and</li>
<li>the amount to be deducted for tax purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>If you pay an overall fee for several undeveloped plots, one form will suffice. Spouses or legal cohabitants who are taxed together and who both deduct fees as actual professional expenses for the same property must attach two attachments for this property to their joint return. If you fail to comply with this reporting requirement, the fees and benefits paid will not be tax deductible.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>This additional disclosure requirement was introduced to assist the tax administration in verifying that private landlords have correctly declared their rental income. For example, tenants who deduct rent as a professional expense must now add an attachment to their tax return as an individual person or as a corporate or legal entity. In that attachment, they must also provide information about the landlord: surname, first name and full address, national registration number or company number.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The administration has indicated that write-offs are not considered fees and therefore should not be included on the new Standard Form 270 MLH.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>No</strong></span><span><strong>270</strong> MLH attachment should be added in the following cases:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>when the rental agreement is<strong> registered free of charge</strong>. </span>In this case, rent cannot be deducted as a professional expense.<span style=""text-align: justify;"">  </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">When a rental agreement is registered free of charge, it is assumed that the property is for residential use only and therefore not used for the professional activity. </span>An exception applies when the property is leased for the sole purpose of providing housing for one or more employees or company directors and possibly their families pursuant to a legal or contractual obligation.<span style=""text-align: justify;"">  </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">The rent may then still be deducted as a professional expense, on condition that the attachment is included with the tax return.</span></li>
<li><span style=""text-align: justify;""></span><span>when an <strong>invoice</strong> or <strong>document valid as such</strong> is issued for the rent or fees for a surface right, ground lease or other right of use in rem.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>when renting out a property with a <strong>lease agreement</strong> in accordance with the leasehold law or a similar foreign law limiting lease rates, that is being used for agricultural or horticultural purposes.</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In your personal income tax return, do not forget to tick the 1072-92 and/or 2072-62 box when adding form 270 MLH.  These codes can be found in box XIII, subsection E. </span>If you have any additional questions or comments about this, please contact us.

"New regulation for foreign employees, directors and researchers as from 1 January 2022",23/12/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>The draft of the new Program Act of December 1, 2021 provides for a new, this time statutory, regulation for foreign employees and directors that will replace the current special tax system for foreign executives, which is still based on an administrative Circular of 1983.</p>
<p>The purpose is to make Belgium permanently attractive for highly qualified foreign personnel and to put a stop to 'abuses' of the existing system. The new system is based on similar systems in our neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>Below you will find the highlights of the new system. </p>
<h2>For whom? </h2>
<p>The new system still applies to employees or company directors who come to work in Belgium from abroad and to employees (not company directors!) who carry out specific scientific research activities for at least 80% of their time. </p>
<h2>Conditions for the employer </h2>
<p>The employees and directors must either be directly recruited abroad by a Belgian employer or be seconded to Belgium by a foreign company that is part of a multinational group.</p>
<h2>Conditions for the employee/ director/ researcher </h2>
<p>In the period of 60 months prior to the start of the employment in Belgium, the person concerned may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>have been a Belgian resident</li>
<li>have lived within 150 km from the Belgian border</li>
<li>have been subject to non-resident income taxation in Belgium on his professional income.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nationality, on the other hand, no longer plays a role.</p>
<p>In addition, a minimum gross remuneration condition of EUR 75.000 applies. This is the gross remuneration before deduction of social contributions but including holiday pay, thirteenth month, benefits in kinds, premiums, bonuses, other gratuities. This condition does not apply to researchers.</p>
<h2>Application procedure </h2>
<p>The employer must submit an application within 3 months of commencement of the employment. </p>
<h2>Costs proper to the employer: the 30% rule </h2>
<p>Recurring costs related to the secondment or employment in Belgium that are paid on top of the normal remuneration, will be regarded as exempt costs proper to the employer, for 30% of the gross remuneration with a maximum of EUR 90.000. This applies, for example, to the additional costs of living, housing, etc. in Belgium compared to the country of origin.</p>
<p>Compensation for certain other costs are not subject to a limitation, provided they are substantiated by underlying supporting documents. This is amongst others the case for the moving costs to Belgium, the school fees for children, ...</p>
<h2>Application period </h2>
<p>The new system will apply for a maximum period of 5 years (possibly to be extended by 3 years).</p>
<p>In order to continue benefitting from the system, the conditions relating to the international nature of the employer and the minimum remuneration will have to be met for non-researchers. </p>
<h2>Taxation in the personal income tax </h2>
<p>Contrary to the current system in which foreign executives by fiction are considered as non-residents, they will from now on be taxed as resident tax payers.</p>
<p>If, however, on the basis of the factual circumstances, they must continue to be regarded as non-residents, a certificate will have to be provided showing that they are effectively taxed as tax resident of another state. </p>
<h2>Entry into force and transition </h2>
<p>The new system would come into effect as from 1 January 2022.</p>
<p>The following transitional arrangement is foreseen for foreign executives who benefit from the current regulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>either they switch to the new system; however, this is only possible if the period of 5 or 8 years has not yet expired and insofar as all the requirements for the new system have been met retroactively. However, if the Administration does not approve the switch, the old system can no longer be applied;</li>
<li>or they remain subject to the old system; this is still possible for 2 years, so until the end of 2023; after that, switching is not possible any more.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>The new Program Act now definitively puts an end to the existing tax regime for foreign executives.</p>
<p>The new system also puts an end to the calculation of the tax-free costs proper to the employer in accordance with the ‘technical note’ of the administration and the travel exclusion.</p>
<p>Whether in practice the new regulation will be more favourable for the employees and employers involved will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. </p>

Registratieverplichting Pijler II,24/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
 In 2021, the OECD (organization containing nearly 140 countries) detailed a plan to combat <strong>Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)</strong>. This plan contained two pillars, whereby “Pillar II” contains agreements on <strong>a global minimum level of taxation</strong>, thus ensuring that large multinationals always pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on their profits.
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">In 2022, in order to ensure that Pillar II rules are<strong> transposed into domestic law in the same way within the EU</strong> (creating a level playing field), the EU issued a Council Directive ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for <strong>multinational enterprise groups</strong> and<strong> large domestic groups in the Union.</strong> The directive has extended the scope of Pillar II to include large domestic groups – not only multinational groups.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">At the end of 2023, the EU directive was transposed into national Belgian law introducing a minimum tax for multinational companies and large domestic groups. This introduced the minimum tax at the Belgian level.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Application of Pillar II</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">The following groups are subject to the minimum tax rate of 15% and are <strong>within the scope of the Pillar II-legislation in Belgium</strong>: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>multinational enterprise groups (MNE groups) and large domestic groups;</li>
<li>with annual turnover of at least €750 million in two or more of the four reporting years preceding the reporting year tested;</li>
<li>with constituent entities* established in Belgium, regardless of whether the ultimate parent entity (UPE) is tax resident in Belgium or elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">* A constituent entity means any entity or permanent establishment of an in-scope group that is subject to the Pillar II rules.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Notification requirement</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">When subject to the minimum tax per Pillar II-legislation in Belgium, the group is subject to the notification requirement for CBE registration (‘Crossroads Bank of Enterprises’)</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How?</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>In order to be able to register with the CBE, the Multinational enterprise group (‘MNE’) or the large-scale national group must notify the FPS Finance using a notification form available on MyMinfin (online platform of the FPS Finance).</span></li>
<li><span> </span>After a complete notification, the group will be registered in the CBE and an e-mail with the group registration number will be send to the entity that notified the group.</li>
<li>In case of an incomplete notification, the Belgian tax authorities will contact the notifying entity to make the necessary amendments. The current legislation does not stipulate a specific penalty in case of late or incorrect filing. However, there could be further consequences due to the lack of a group registration number, such as being unable to submit a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) return within the deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 115%;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>When?</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The notification should be made no later than 30 days after the start of the tax year for which the group of MNE or the large-scale national group falls within the scope of the law of 19 December 2023. For example, if the first fiscal year starts on 1 January 2025, the notification deadline is 30 January 2025.</span></li>
<li><span> </span>For those who are already subject to Pillar 2 in the meantime (e.g. from 1 January 2024), the first notification must take place no later than 45 days after the publication of the Royal Decree of 15 May 2024 in the Belgian Official Gazette.

"Do not forget your country-by-country notification before March 31, 2018!",12/03/2018,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
Belgium  has implemented new Transfer Pricing documentation rules for accounting years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. One of the documentation requirements is the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">country-by-country reporting</span>. A country-by-country report must be filed by every multinational group with gross proceeds of at least 750 million on a consolidated basis. In principle it is the ultimate parent company of the group that needs to file the report, but in some cases another group company must be designed. <br>
<br>
According to Belgian tax law, the Belgian group entity must notify the Belgian tax authorities, ultimately the last day of the accounting period concerned, which group entity will file the country-by-country report. For accounting years ended on December 31, 2017, a one-off delay until <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">March 31, 2018</span> is foreseen. Do not forget this!<br>

Lump sum allowance for employees working from home – Fast track application and approval procedure,23/03/2020,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>More and more sectors and companies are introducing compulsory homework as a result of the current Corona (Covid-19) crisis and the measures of the National Security Council. Employers who grant a temporary additional home-work allowance to their employees can now also quickly and efficiently obtain confirmation from the tax authorities that the allowance granted qualifies as an employer expense for tax purposes, exempt from tax in the hands of the employee.</span></p>
<p>To this end, an employer can obtain a straightforward ruling via an accelerated procedure at the Belgian ruling commission. This is a specific, temporary measure that will be introduced to compensate employees for the additional costs incurred whilst working from home during the current Corona (Covid-19) crisis. The compensation must be a lump sum payment of a maximum of EUR 126.94 per month. No distinction must be made between different job categories within the company, but all employees who have to work at home because of the measures against the Covid-19 virus, should receive the same compensation.</p>
<p>When awarding the compensation, employers must observe some ground rules. For example, the employer must submit an application for costs specific to the employer for home work under the government measures for Covid-19, to the ruling committee. Although this may seem cumbersome, the approval procedure takes place under minimal conditions (formal but shortened application, temporary character, no double use,…).</p>

When it is mandatory to appoint a statutory auditor?,13/06/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span>Everyone knows the criteria for determining whether or not a company is 'large' and therefore, in principle, must appoint a statutory auditor.  But what if a company is part of a group that must or must not consolidate? And what if the company is part of an international group?<br>
What follows is a short summary.<br>
</span></p>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Stand-alone companies   </span></h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>A company is considered to be large and must therefore appoint a statutory auditor if more than one of the following three criteria is exceeded:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual average workforce: 50 employees</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual turnover excluding VAT: 9,000,000 euros</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Balance sheet total: 4,500,000 euros</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>If more than one of these three criteria is exceeded or no longer exceeded, this only has consequences if this occurs in two consecutive financial years. The consequences will then take effect from the following financial year. </span>Suppose: a company exceeds more than one of the three criteria for the financial years 2019  and 2020, then it will be considered large as from the financial year 2021 and must appoint a statutory auditor.</p>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Companies that are part of a Belgian group that is required to consolidate</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When a company is part of a group of companies that are obliged to consolidate, a statutory auditor must be appointed even if the company concerned is considered small in itself. </span>In Belgium, the consolidation obligation exists for any company that alone or jointly controls one or more subsidiaries or forms a consortium, except:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company itself is a subsidiary.</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company is a parent company that only has subsidiaries of negligible significance.</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>When the company is part of a group of ‘limited’ size.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>A group of ‘’limited’ size is then a group that on a consolidated basis does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual average workforce: 250 employees</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Annual turnover excluding VAT: 34,000,000 euros</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Balance sheet total: 17 million euros</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>These criteria must be verified on the closing date of the consolidating company's financial year. I</span>f more than one of these three criteria is exceeded or no longer exceeded, this only has consequences if this occurs in two consecutive financial years. The consequences will then take effect from the following financial year.</p>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Companies that are part of an international group that is required to consolidate</span></h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Also when a company is part of an international group of companies that is obliged to consolidate, a statutory auditor must be appointed. In this regard, consideration should be given to the rules on consolidation obligations that apply abroad, which may be stricter than the Belgian ones, so that, the case being, consolidation must be carried out more quickly there than in Belgium.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>It is therefore possible that a small Belgian company has to appoint a statutory auditor because of a consolidation obligation abroad.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span> </span></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Sanctions</h3>
<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>If a statutory auditor is not appointed, the following sanctions may be imposed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span></span>Judicial appointment of a statutory auditor: this can be requested by any party that has an interest.</li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Nullity of the resolution of the general meeting approving the annual accounts.</span></li>
<li style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span>Directors' liability for violation of the company law.<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Conclusion</h3>
<p style=""color: #000000; background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span>In particular, companies that are part of an international group must ensure that they are aware of the consolidation rules abroad.</span></p>

Relaxation for fee forms 281.50 on the way,23/12/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>In order to safeguard the deductibility of payments made to certain beneficiaries, companies and self-employed persons are required to report these payments on a form 281.50. These forms must be submitted annually by June 30th for payments made during the previous calendar year.</p>
<h2>Current regulation</h2>
<p>This obligation exists amongst others for the payment or granting of commissions, fees, brokerage fees, trade or other refunds, attendance fees, bonuses, (management) fees or benefits in kind which are taxable professional income for the recipients and which are not subject to the accounting obligations as included in the Code of Economic Law (amongst others the preparation of annual accounts) or for which no invoice has been issued.</p>
<p>Payments to foreign beneficiaries must in any case be mentioned on a form.</p>
<p>However, if the total amount per recipient per year is less than EUR 125.00, no form needs to be drawn up.</p>
<h2>Announced relaxation</h2>
<p>The regulation itself will not change. The obligation to draw up forms 281.50 will remain in full force.</p>
<p>It will only be abolished for payments following the supply of goods or services within the European Economic Area (EU, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein) and where such transactions are subject to a legal or regulatory obligation to issue an ""invoice or a document in lieu"". </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is left to the King to set a ceiling below which no forms must be drawn up. However, this ceiling may not exceed EUR 1.000 per year per recipient. </p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The changes would come into effect for payments made from 1 January 2021 and therefore already apply to the forms that must be submitted before 30 June 2022. The draft bill still needs to be approved. </p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>The relaxation for foreign beneficiaries is likely to lead to a reduction in administrative obligations for some taxpayers. For the ceiling, we still have to wait.</p>

Modification of the VAT exemption for medical care,08/10/2021,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p>Medical care is in principle exempt from VAT in the European Union. To this end, an VAT exemption was implemented at the European level for services provided by (para)medical professionals and medical care (as well as closely related supplies of goods and services) provided by hospitals. </p>
<p>In its case law, the Court of Justice of the European Union has consistenly ruled that only services which have a therapeutic aim can be exempted on the basis of the aforementioned VAT exemption. Whether or not a service has a therapeutic aim must be assessed by reference to both the factual and the legal context in which the service is performed.</p>
<p>In the Belgian VAT legislation and administrative guidelines, the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care is currently linked to the capacity of the service provider (qualified care providers, accredited care institutions, etc.) and the type of services (services included in the nomenclature of medical services). </p>
<p>The therapeutic or non-therapeutic aim of a services is currently not the essential criterion in Belgian VAT legislation and administrative guidelines for exempting (or not) a (para)medical service from VAT. Today, for example, medical services of an aesthetic nature are already excluded from the VAT exemptions for medical care, but many other non-therapeutic services performed by (para)medical professionals and the medical institutions are still exempt from VAT.<br>
In addition, certain healthcare providers, e.g. chiropractors and osteopaths, were principally excluded from the VAT exemption for medical care due to the fact that they belong to a non-regulated profession. </p>
<p>Compared to the European legislation and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Belgian legislator and VAT administration apply the VAT exemption for medical care too strictly and too broadly at the same time. Following the Belgian Constitutional Court's ruling No. 194/2019 of December 5, 2019, a thorough review of Belgian VAT legislation and administrative guidelines in this regard was necessary. </p>
<h2>Modification of VAT exemption for medical care as from January 1, 2022</h2>
<p>In order to bring Belgian practice regarding the VAT exemption for medical care in line with European legislation as well as the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Belgian Constitutional Court, the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care in Belgium is being revised. The changes will take effect from January 1, 2022.</p>
<p>From now on, the VAT exemption for medical care will be limited to services relating to interventions and treatments with a therapeutic aim. This means that non-therapeutic treatments will principally no longer be able to benefit from the VAT exemption for medical care. </p>
<p>In addition, the services of non-regulated (para)medical professions can also benefit from the VAT exemption – provided their qualifications are recognized by the VAT administration. More specifically, as from 1 January 2022, the VAT exemption can be claimed by, on the one hand, (para)medical care providers with a degree issued by a recognized educational institution and, on the other hand, by persons who possess the necessary qualifications to provide medical care of a sufficiently high level of quality to be comparable to the medical care provided by the aforementioned qualified (para)medical care providers, for example chiropractors and osteopaths. It goes without saying that (para)medical care can only be VAT exempt if a therapeutic aim is present.</p>
<p>Finally, incidental supplies of goods and services by healthcare institutions, the so-called ""supplies closely related to hospital care"" transactions, will only be exempt from VAT as of January 1, 2022, provided that (i) they are indispensable for the provision of the exempted medical care, or (ii) they are not primarily intended to provide the institution with additional revenue through the performance of transactions carried out in direct competition with transactions of commercial enterprises subject to VAT. These conditions are not cumulative. The establishment of one of the aforementioned circumstances is sufficient to exclude the application of the VAT exemption.Wat is de impact voor de medische sector?</p>
<h2>What is the impact for the medical sector?</h2>
<p>Although the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care is both broadened and limited by the aforementioned legislative amendment, in our opinion the main impact of the amendment will be felt on the side of the limitation of the VAT exemption.</p>
<p>Today, the Belgian administrative guidelines allow a great many services (and supplies of goods) without a therapeutic aim to fall within the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care. These include the existing directives and tolerances regarding the provision of televisions and telephones to patients, the operation of drinking and eating establishments by healthcare institutions, the operation of hospital car parks, hairdressing or manicuring services for patients, etc. </p>
<p>Will the change in the scope of the VAT exemption for medical care revolutionize medical services? On a first reading of the legislative documents, the upcoming amendment indeed seems to hold a major change. However, the practical implementation of the legislative change by the VAT administration will have to provide more clarity. The Belgian VAT administration has indicated that it will publish new administrative guidelines, in principle before the new legislation enters into force on January 1, 2022.</p>

Changes to European rules governing the size of companies,26/06/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p><span>Recently, the European Commission published a Directive (EU 2023/2775 of 17 October 2023) adjusting the size criteria for undertakings, taking into account the inflation that has occurred in recent years.  This Directive has since been transposed into Belgian law.</span></p>
<p><span>The new criteria will enter into force for financial years commencing from 1 January 2024 onwards.  This means that companies will continue to be classified as small for longer.</span></p>
<p><span>The size of a company is not only important when determining the model of financial statements and reporting but it also has tax implications.  In many cases, small companies therefore enjoy favourable tax regimes, including: a reduced rate, investment deduction and liquidation reserves.</span></p>

Change procedure optional VAT liability,24/01/2024,"<div class=""article-header__content rich-text"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In Belgium, any person who, other than in the exercise of his <strong>VAT taxable economic activity</strong>, has erected or acquired a <strong>""new"" building</strong> or <strong>part of a ""new"" building</strong> with application of VAT, has the right to opt for the status of coincidental VAT taxpayer when the latter wishes to sell this immovable property or to establish or (re)transfer a right in rem on it with application of VAT. One of the conditions is that the property is still considered ""new"" within the meaning of the VAT code, i.e. the transfer of the property or of the right in rem <strong>takes place no later than 31 December</strong> of the second year following the year of the first occupation or first use of the building or part of building in question.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The advantage of this <strong>optional VAT liability</strong> is that the VAT on the establishment or purchase of the real estate <strong>can be recovered</strong> in this way. The Belgian VAT administration requires certain notification and declaration formalities to be complied with in order for the optional VAT tax liability to be exercised, namely: </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span> </span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span><strong>Prior to the sale</strong>, the seller is obliged to submit to the VAT authorities an advance declaration on paper (declaration no. 104.1);</span></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span><strong>An express statement</strong> of the intention to dispose of the property with VAT or to create or (re)transfer the immovable right in rem with the application of VAT must be included in the first deed concluded between the parties. When disposing of a property, this is usually the contract of sale (although it is accepted that this intention is concretised in a promise of sale). Upon submission of Declaration No 104.1, the transferor or transferee receives a file number from the VAT administration, which the notary includes in the deed of transfer or establishment. This file number provides assurance to the notary and the co-contractor that the sale is taking place under the VAT regime.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>After the sale</strong>, the seller must submit a special declaration (declaration no. 104.5) to the VAT administration. This declaration no. 104.5 shall be submitted within the month after the VAT has become due and must state the amount received from the buyer (taxable amount and VAT), the VAT deducted and the difference between the VAT due and deductible on the part of the seller (or transferor). The VAT balance will have to be paid or refunded, as the case may be.</li>
</ol>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>In response to the administrative burden these formalities imposed on the VAT administration, it was decided to <strong>simplify and modernise</strong> the aforementioned procedure.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The <strong>obligation to submit</strong> prior declaration no. 104.1 will be abolished without further ado. The follow-up of real estate transactions with application of VAT will henceforth be done <strong>on the basis of the first deed between the parties</strong> showing the transferor's intention to apply VAT to the sale or on the basis of the notarial deed between the parties. Thus, the aforementioned step 1 in the administrative procedure will be abolished. However, step 2 (entry of intention to apply VAT) and step 3 (filing of special declaration (declaration no. 104.5)) remain valid</span></p>
