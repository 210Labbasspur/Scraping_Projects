Click Fuel Prices and type in location eg LPFR and click "See Results"
There is a graphql function call, review the JSON from this and compare it to the sample invoice so you can compute the cost of 150 and 300 litres of fuel.

You can see a sample invoice on this page:
https://myworld.air.wfscorp.com/invoices/regular;source=fromL1
The invoice is for 182 litres in the example.


Output as csv and kml file with calculation for 150 and 300 litres total price. Also show the breakdown of the price computation eg hookup fee, taxes etc.

I have attached a file called Air BP locations which shows you the full list of airports, I would just suggest to start with Portugal and Spain initially but see if it runs over all airports, you can also find within the website more information.

There will be some work in figuring out the price as some conditional items might not apply too (eg overtime fee) so you might have to have some logic around this. There are sample invoices to help you with this.

Please keep me advised on how you areÂ progressing.
