Most canes are fine for standing. But what about when you're getting up from a chair, getting out of a car and climbing up stairs? Traditional canes just weren't designed for it. But the very first time you use a HurryCane®, you realize how delightfully different it is. That's because we built it from the ground up to feel like an extension of the body. And that's why people everywhere are loving it. This product is also backed by Drive Medical's Limited Lifetime Warranty.
,Specifications,8 convenient height adjustments,360 degree pivoting head,Freestanding design,Anodized aluminum shaft,Easily folds down for storage,Wrist strap and travel bag included,Stabilizes Like a Foot,
,
Just like the human foot, the HurryCane® gives you 3 points of contact for superior balance and stability. It naturally simulates your instinctive walking motion. Whether you're sitting or standing, the SteadiGrip™ base gives you more traction at almost any angle.
,Pivots Like an Ankle,
,
The ankle is the most complex joint in the body because it has the trickiest job: support your full weight while giving you the flexibility to walk, run and turn on a dime. It automatically pivots to help you maintain balance on inclines, uneven ground and shifting terrain. We designed the HurryCane's proprietary pivot head to meet the same demanding standards − and it does it all, automatically.
,Changes in Height,
,
People come in all different heights. That's why we engineered the HurryCane® to lengthen and shorten in seconds. With just the push of a button, it instantly adjusts to the right height. The Freedom Edition™ has 8 height settings, ranging from 30½"" to 37½"". The GO™ has 10 height setting, ranging from 29½"" to 38½. If only the human body were so advanced.
,Bends Like a Knee,
,
Your knees bend to help you get in and out of restrictive places like cars. But the HurryCane® Freedom Edition™ is even better: instead of one joint, you get 3! When you need to store it in a purse, glove box or under a chair, the HurryCane® folds up in seconds to one-third its normal size. And when you need it, it can be assembled almost instantly. While our cane has three joints, it's still strong and sturdy enough to support up to 350 pounds.

The one of a kind ,Magic Bullet Suppository, is designed to aid with chronic constipation and bowel impaction. ,Who uses the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,The typical user of the Magic Bullet Suppository is an individual with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)or disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spina bifida, long-term care, or stroke where damage occurred to the nerves that allow a person to control bowel movements. Additionally, any persons suffering from constipation associated with oncology or opioid treatment. Magic Bullet Suppositories are incorporated into Bowel Management programs for individuals with neurogenic bowels to help prevent unplanned bowel movements and other bowel problems such as constipation, diarrhea, and impaction. The Magic Bullet Suppository® is recommended by most major rehab centers.
,What ingredients are in the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,10mg of bisacodyl ,Polyethylene Glycol base (water-soluble),Why use the Magic Bullet Suppository vs. Dulcolax, Theravac/Enemeez, CEO-TWO, Fleets, and hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories?,
,
Dulcolax and the other Bisacodyl suppositories have the same active ingredient (10mg Bisacodyl) as The Magic Bullet. The base or carrier of the active ingredient in the suppository is what differentiates the Magic Bullet from all of the rest. The Magic Bullet uses a Polyethylene Glycol base which is water-soluble. This base allows the Bisacodyl to be activated by the body’s own moisture shortly after insertion. The Dulcolax and other Bisacodyl suppositories use a vegetable oil base. This type of base takes longer to work because it needs time to be melted by the body's heat, which can cause continued mucosal irritation with resultant mucus accidents (anal leakage) hours after the Bowel Program (BP).
,
Clinical Studies have shown that The Magic Bullet proves to be just as effective as mini enemas like Therevac and Enemeez in a bowel program plus they're easier to use as it requires less hand dexterity.
,
The Magic Bullet uses stimulation of the bowel wall to cause peristalsis to push out the stool. CeoTwo on the other hand produces a gas inside the bowel which relaxes the bowel, causing the movement.
,
The Magic Bullet is far less costly than its competition. Less than half the price of Dulcolax, and less than a quarter the price of mini enemas.
,
Finally, it is concluded that the replacement of hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories with Polyethylene Glycol base suppository, such as The Magic Bullet, will reduce bowel care time by 50%(J Spinal CordMed1997;20:227 229).
,How should the Magic Bullet be inserted?,
,
Remove the suppository from the outer white wrapper. You should use a water-soluble lubricant such as KY or Surgilube to ease insertion and ensure ease of entry. Vaseline (Petroleum Jelly) should NEVER be used as it is a barrier between the active ingredient and the bowel.
,IMPORTANT PLEASE READ,
,Magic Bullets only need to be refrigerated if the household temperature goes above 76 degrees. It is not recommended that they ever be frozen. Freezing can destroy the effectiveness of the active ingredient rendering the Magic Bullet useless.,The Magic Bullet has a 6-month expiration date (shelf life).

,The typical user of the Magic Bullet Suppository is an individual with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)or disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spina bifida, long-term care, or stroke where damage occurred to the nerves that allow a person to control bowel movements. Additionally, any persons suffering from constipation associated with oncology or opioid treatment. Magic Bullet Suppositories are incorporated into Bowel Management programs for individuals with neurogenic bowels to help prevent unplanned bowel movements and other bowel problems such as constipation, diarrhea, and impaction. The Magic Bullet Suppository® is recommended by most major rehab centers.
,What ingredients are in the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,10mg of bisacodyl ,Polyethylene Glycol base (water-soluble),Why use the Magic Bullet Suppository vs. Dulcolax, Theravac/Enemeez, CEO-TWO, Fleets, and hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories?,
,
Dulcolax and the other Bisacodyl suppositories have the same active ingredient (10mg Bisacodyl) as The Magic Bullet. The base or carrier of the active ingredient in the suppository is what differentiates the Magic Bullet from all of the rest. The Magic Bullet uses a Polyethylene Glycol base which is water-soluble. This base allows the Bisacodyl to be activated by the body’s own moisture shortly after insertion. The Dulcolax and other Bisacodyl suppositories use a vegetable oil base. This type of base takes longer to work because it needs time to be melted by the body's heat, which can cause continued mucosal irritation with resultant mucus accidents (anal leakage) hours after the Bowel Program (BP).
,
Clinical Studies have shown that The Magic Bullet proves to be just as effective as mini enemas like Therevac and Enemeez in a bowel program plus they're easier to use as it requires less hand dexterity.
,
The Magic Bullet uses stimulation of the bowel wall to cause peristalsis to push out the stool. CeoTwo on the other hand produces a gas inside the bowel which relaxes the bowel, causing the movement.
,
The Magic Bullet is far less costly than its competition. Less than half the price of Dulcolax, and less than a quarter the price of mini enemas.
,
Finally, it is concluded that the replacement of hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories with Polyethylene Glycol base suppository, such as The Magic Bullet, will reduce bowel care time by 50%(J Spinal CordMed1997;20:227 229).
,How should the Magic Bullet be inserted?,
,
Remove the suppository from the outer white wrapper. You should use a water-soluble lubricant such as KY or Surgilube to ease insertion and ensure ease of entry. Vaseline (Petroleum Jelly) should NEVER be used as it is a barrier between the active ingredient and the bowel.
,IMPORTANT PLEASE READ,
,Magic Bullets only need to be refrigerated if the household temperature goes above 76 degrees. It is not recommended that they ever be frozen. Freezing can destroy the effectiveness of the active ingredient rendering the Magic Bullet useless.,The Magic Bullet has a 6-month expiration date (shelf life).

The one of a kind ,Magic Bullet Suppository, is designed to aid with chronic constipation and bowel impaction. ,Who uses the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,The typical user of the Magic Bullet Suppository is an individual with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)or disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spina bifida, long-term care, or stroke where damage occurred to the nerves that allow a person to control bowel movements. Additionally, any persons suffering from constipation associated with oncology or opioid treatment. Magic Bullet Suppositories are incorporated into Bowel Management programs for individuals with neurogenic bowels to help prevent unplanned bowel movements and other bowel problems such as constipation, diarrhea, and impaction. The Magic Bullet Suppository® is recommended by most major rehab centers.
,What ingredients are in the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,10mg of bisacodyl ,Polyethylene Glycol base (water-soluble),Why use the Magic Bullet Suppository vs. Dulcolax, Theravac/Enemeez, CEO-TWO, Fleets, and hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories?,
,
Dulcolax and the other Bisacodyl suppositories have the same active ingredient (10mg Bisacodyl) as The Magic Bullet. The base or carrier of the active ingredient in the suppository is what differentiates the Magic Bullet from all of the rest. The Magic Bullet uses a Polyethylene Glycol base which is water-soluble. This base allows the Bisacodyl to be activated by the body’s own moisture shortly after insertion. The Dulcolax and other Bisacodyl suppositories use a vegetable oil base. This type of base takes longer to work because it needs time to be melted by the body's heat, which can cause continued mucosal irritation with resultant mucus accidents (anal leakage) hours after the Bowel Program (BP).
,
Clinical Studies have shown that The Magic Bullet proves to be just as effective as mini enemas like Therevac and Enemeez in a bowel program plus they're easier to use as it requires less hand dexterity.
,
The Magic Bullet uses stimulation of the bowel wall to cause peristalsis to push out the stool. CeoTwo on the other hand produces a gas inside the bowel which relaxes the bowel, causing the movement.
,
The Magic Bullet is far less costly than its competition. Less than half the price of Dulcolax, and less than a quarter the price of mini enemas.
,
Finally, it is concluded that the replacement of hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories with Polyethylene Glycol base suppository, such as The Magic Bullet, will reduce bowel care time by 50%(J Spinal CordMed1997;20:227 229).
,How should the Magic Bullet be inserted?,
,
Remove the suppository from the outer white wrapper. You should use a water-soluble lubricant such as KY or Surgilube to ease insertion and ensure ease of entry. Vaseline (Petroleum Jelly) should NEVER be used as it is a barrier between the active ingredient and the bowel.
,IMPORTANT PLEASE READ,
,Magic Bullets only need to be refrigerated if the household temperature goes above 76 degrees. It is not recommended that they ever be frozen. Freezing can destroy the effectiveness of the active ingredient rendering the Magic Bullet useless.,The Magic Bullet has a 6-month expiration date (shelf life).

Dulcolax and the other Bisacodyl suppositories have the same active ingredient (10mg Bisacodyl) as The Magic Bullet. The base or carrier of the active ingredient in the suppository is what differentiates the Magic Bullet from all of the rest. The Magic Bullet uses a Polyethylene Glycol base which is water-soluble. This base allows the Bisacodyl to be activated by the body’s own moisture shortly after insertion. The Dulcolax and other Bisacodyl suppositories use a vegetable oil base. This type of base takes longer to work because it needs time to be melted by the body's heat, which can cause continued mucosal irritation with resultant mucus accidents (anal leakage) hours after the Bowel Program (BP).
,
Clinical Studies have shown that The Magic Bullet proves to be just as effective as mini enemas like Therevac and Enemeez in a bowel program plus they're easier to use as it requires less hand dexterity.
,
The Magic Bullet uses stimulation of the bowel wall to cause peristalsis to push out the stool. CeoTwo on the other hand produces a gas inside the bowel which relaxes the bowel, causing the movement.
,
The Magic Bullet is far less costly than its competition. Less than half the price of Dulcolax, and less than a quarter the price of mini enemas.
,
Finally, it is concluded that the replacement of hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories with Polyethylene Glycol base suppository, such as The Magic Bullet, will reduce bowel care time by 50%(J Spinal CordMed1997;20:227 229).
,How should the Magic Bullet be inserted?,
,
Remove the suppository from the outer white wrapper. You should use a water-soluble lubricant such as KY or Surgilube to ease insertion and ensure ease of entry. Vaseline (Petroleum Jelly) should NEVER be used as it is a barrier between the active ingredient and the bowel.
,IMPORTANT PLEASE READ,
,Magic Bullets only need to be refrigerated if the household temperature goes above 76 degrees. It is not recommended that they ever be frozen. Freezing can destroy the effectiveness of the active ingredient rendering the Magic Bullet useless.,The Magic Bullet has a 6-month expiration date (shelf life).

The one of a kind ,Magic Bullet Suppository, is designed to aid with chronic constipation and bowel impaction. ,Who uses the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,The typical user of the Magic Bullet Suppository is an individual with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)or disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spina bifida, long-term care, or stroke where damage occurred to the nerves that allow a person to control bowel movements. Additionally, any persons suffering from constipation associated with oncology or opioid treatment. Magic Bullet Suppositories are incorporated into Bowel Management programs for individuals with neurogenic bowels to help prevent unplanned bowel movements and other bowel problems such as constipation, diarrhea, and impaction. The Magic Bullet Suppository® is recommended by most major rehab centers.
,What ingredients are in the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,10mg of bisacodyl ,Polyethylene Glycol base (water-soluble),Why use the Magic Bullet Suppository vs. Dulcolax, Theravac/Enemeez, CEO-TWO, Fleets, and hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories?,
,
Dulcolax and the other Bisacodyl suppositories have the same active ingredient (10mg Bisacodyl) as The Magic Bullet. The base or carrier of the active ingredient in the suppository is what differentiates the Magic Bullet from all of the rest. The Magic Bullet uses a Polyethylene Glycol base which is water-soluble. This base allows the Bisacodyl to be activated by the body’s own moisture shortly after insertion. The Dulcolax and other Bisacodyl suppositories use a vegetable oil base. This type of base takes longer to work because it needs time to be melted by the body's heat, which can cause continued mucosal irritation with resultant mucus accidents (anal leakage) hours after the Bowel Program (BP).
,
Clinical Studies have shown that The Magic Bullet proves to be just as effective as mini enemas like Therevac and Enemeez in a bowel program plus they're easier to use as it requires less hand dexterity.
,
The Magic Bullet uses stimulation of the bowel wall to cause peristalsis to push out the stool. CeoTwo on the other hand produces a gas inside the bowel which relaxes the bowel, causing the movement.
,
The Magic Bullet is far less costly than its competition. Less than half the price of Dulcolax, and less than a quarter the price of mini enemas.
,
Finally, it is concluded that the replacement of hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories with Polyethylene Glycol base suppository, such as The Magic Bullet, will reduce bowel care time by 50%(J Spinal CordMed1997;20:227 229).
,How should the Magic Bullet be inserted?,
,
Remove the suppository from the outer white wrapper. You should use a water-soluble lubricant such as KY or Surgilube to ease insertion and ensure ease of entry. Vaseline (Petroleum Jelly) should NEVER be used as it is a barrier between the active ingredient and the bowel.
,IMPORTANT PLEASE READ,
,Magic Bullets only need to be refrigerated if the household temperature goes above 76 degrees. It is not recommended that they ever be frozen. Freezing can destroy the effectiveness of the active ingredient rendering the Magic Bullet useless.,The Magic Bullet has a 6-month expiration date (shelf life).

The one of a kind ,Magic Bullet Suppository, is designed to aid with chronic constipation and bowel impaction. ,Who uses the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,The typical user of the Magic Bullet Suppository is an individual with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)or disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spina bifida, long-term care, or stroke where damage occurred to the nerves that allow a person to control bowel movements. Additionally, any persons suffering from constipation associated with oncology or opioid treatment. Magic Bullet Suppositories are incorporated into Bowel Management programs for individuals with neurogenic bowels to help prevent unplanned bowel movements and other bowel problems such as constipation, diarrhea, and impaction. The Magic Bullet Suppository® is recommended by most major rehab centers.
,What ingredients are in the Magic Bullet Suppository?,
,10mg of bisacodyl ,Polyethylene Glycol base (water-soluble),Why use the Magic Bullet Suppository vs. Dulcolax, Theravac/Enemeez, CEO-TWO, Fleets, and hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories?,
,
Dulcolax and the other Bisacodyl suppositories have the same active ingredient (10mg Bisacodyl) as The Magic Bullet. The base or carrier of the active ingredient in the suppository is what differentiates the Magic Bullet from all of the rest. The Magic Bullet uses a Polyethylene Glycol base which is water-soluble. This base allows the Bisacodyl to be activated by the body’s own moisture shortly after insertion. The Dulcolax and other Bisacodyl suppositories use a vegetable oil base. This type of base takes longer to work because it needs time to be melted by the body's heat, which can cause continued mucosal irritation with resultant mucus accidents (anal leakage) hours after the Bowel Program (BP).
,
Clinical Studies have shown that The Magic Bullet proves to be just as effective as mini enemas like Therevac and Enemeez in a bowel program plus they're easier to use as it requires less hand dexterity.
,
The Magic Bullet uses stimulation of the bowel wall to cause peristalsis to push out the stool. CeoTwo on the other hand produces a gas inside the bowel which relaxes the bowel, causing the movement.
,
The Magic Bullet is far less costly than its competition. Less than half the price of Dulcolax, and less than a quarter the price of mini enemas.
,
Finally, it is concluded that the replacement of hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl (HVB) suppositories with Polyethylene Glycol base suppository, such as The Magic Bullet, will reduce bowel care time by 50%(J Spinal CordMed1997;20:227 229).
,How should the Magic Bullet be inserted?,
,
Remove the suppository from the outer white wrapper. You should use a water-soluble lubricant such as KY or Surgilube to ease insertion and ensure ease of entry. Vaseline (Petroleum Jelly) should NEVER be used as it is a barrier between the active ingredient and the bowel.

At the advice of our veterinarian, I have sought a lightweight cane to use to separate animals in the event our dog is approached during our walks. The price for this cane was very attractive and I like natural wood canes, so I purchased this particular one. To my surprise, this cane was very solid, nicely finished, and very light for easy carry. I am 61 years old, so I find this cane to be a welcome companion to help steady myself while walking. In Texas, a cane is also useful to protect against any snakes or coyotes. The slender diameter, wood hardness, and being light weight, make this cane an excellent choice as an all-around cane for either male or female, though it may have to be sized to suit. I even enjoy twirling it! Some large discount hardware stores in our area will cut canes free of charge. I am very pleased with my purchase and would do the same, again. I would highly recommend this cane to anyone. I ordered two canes and both arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I have not used this cane in wet weather.

, is an unique new splint solves the
difficult problem of positioning a weak or ""hemi"" hand on a
walker. There are many issues associated with hand weakness and
walker use. The hand can slip off the grip or slip out of
position, limiting the users ability to control the walker and
the amount of trunk support provided. Soft walker cuffs can't
hold a heavy hand securely in position and don't hold their shape
in the presence of mild to moderate flexor tone.
,
The Walker Hand Splint maintains proper wrist alignment and
provides weight bearing through the appropriate parts of the
hand. The criss-cross straps easily secure the hand in place and
can even be fastened by the user. The malleable aluminum core
allows the splint to be molded to fit most any hand and walker
grip. An adhesive hook and loop stip (included) is placed on the
walker grip to attach to the hook-sensitive surface of the
splint, securing it in place. Comfortable, padded terry cover
keeps skin dry and protected. Removeable cover for easy
laundering. Hand wash with warm soap and water, air dry. One
size, choose Left or Right.

You can either use the scale with the display connected to the platform, (saves power) or use the display completely wirelessly with Bluetooth technology! When you're in wireless mode you need six batteries for the base and the included adapter for the display. If you want the ultimate in wireless, stick six batteries in the display, too, and take it up to 18 feet from the base. No power outlet needed! If you don't really need a wireless display, hook the display to the base with the included cable and you only need to power the display with either the included power adapter or six batteries. The PD750L has a whoppin' 18 inch by 14 inch platform. Before you spend your dough on this mighty scale, make sure you have room!,This bariatric scale has a USB port so ya can send your weight readings to your computer. This will save ya from having to write down your weights...the USB cable is even included! You won't have to worry about dust and dirt getting stuck under and around this obesity scale's buttons...The PD750L has an easy to clean membrane keypad with accurately labeled keys for easy weighing. To make sure ya get the most accurate weight readings from this high capacity scale, My Weigh designed the PD-750L with adjustable feet. So no matter where you're weighing you can make sure your scale is nice and leveled. The tare button on the PD750L weight display can be pressed to ""zero out"" the weight on the scale. You can then add more weight, and the display will only show the weight of the items you're adding.  If you ever have a problem with the PD750-L, just send it in to My Weigh's warranty center in Phoenix, Arizona.

Contains chemicals called anthraquinones that stimulate intestinal contractions which work to push undigested material down the intestinal tract. This provides a laxative effect. In addition, Casgrada Sagrada Also restores natural tone to the colon.,
Have long been known to have effective laxative action. However, Scientists have not yet isolated the active components. Prune does contain soluble fiber, but even when the fiber is removed, the laxative effect remains.,
Contains three unidentified isoquinoline alkoloids and has been reported to have spasmolytic effects on smooth muscles. In this way it works in much the same way as casgrada. Barberry also has antibiotic properties and has been used traditionally by Ayurvedic doctors to combat organisms in the digestive tract.,
Has several properties that make it desirable in a laxative preparation. Traditionally it has been used as an antispasmodic, carminative (aid in the expulsion of gas), and stomachic for the treatment of upset stomach and indigestion. Two chemicals in Caraway seeds, carvol ,
and carvene, have been shown to soothe the smooth muscle tissue ,
in the digestive tract and help expel gas.,
Appears to relax the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract, ,
which explains its antispasmodic effect. It also helps to expel gas. ,
In Germany, fennel is used pharmaceutically as a treatment for indigestion, gas pains, and infant colic.,
Contains ample amounts of a complex mixture of anthraquinones and anthraquinoneglycosides, similar to that found in Casgrada bark, and therefore provides a similar laxative effect.,
Among its many uses, Ginger (mainly as the oleoresin) is used as an ingredient in certain digestive, laxative, antitussive, carminative and antacid preparations. It appears to relieve indigestion and abdominal cramping by soothing the gastrointestinal tract. It also has anti-nausea action, and contains substances similar to digestive enzymes.,
In its various forms (herb, seed, extracts and oils) has been reported to have numerous pharmacological and biological properties, one of which is a laxative effect. The mild laxative effect is the result of two major chemicals, apiol and myristicin.,
Aloe contains the same laxative chemicals (anthraquinones) as Casgrada Sagrada and Yellow Dock, though it may even be more powerful. In Germany, concentrated dried aloe leaf juice is used for conditions in which ease of defecation and soft stool are required, e.g., anal fissures, hemorrhoids, post anorectal surgery, and refractory constipation.,
Is another ingredient that stimulates peristalsis, the muscular contractions that move food and then stool through the bowels. This can help prevent and possibly eliminate constipation. It may also keep toxins in the stool from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream.,
Is thought to work in much the same way as Chlorella in cleansing ,
and detoxifying the intestinal tract as well as stimulating intestinal contractions.,
Enzymes serve many roles in maintaining intestinal health. Lipase, Amylase and Protease aid the body's own pancreatic enzymes in breaking down large ingested molecules into smaller molecules and molecular fragments that can be more easily absorbed and utilized by the body., Cellulase, which is not produced by the body, breaks the bonds in the cell walls of plant molecules making plant fiber and other cellular components more bioavailible. Regular use of supplemental enzymes is known to contribute to overall bowel health.","Helps soften stool and brings it down lower in the bowel,Encourages regularity and cleansing of digestive tract,Can be used in conjunction with the Magic Bullet or by itself",Magic Bullet,CCMC90,1,,,,
