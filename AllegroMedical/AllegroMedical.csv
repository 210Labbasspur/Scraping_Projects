Mannose Magic - Bottle of 60,827 0184,Magic Bullet,$37.72,"While Cranberry supplements work well for many people, there are those of us who need something else. If this is the case for you, then our new Mannose Magic may be exactly what you've been looking for. The Mannose molecules collect in your urine. When E-Coli bacteria are present they hook onto the Mannose rather than the bladder wall. These bacteria are now encapsulated by the Mannose Magic.,Upon urination these bacteria are flushed away. If the E-Coli bacteria are constantly flushed away with the Mannose, it will help stop these bacteria from causing UTI's. As 90 percent of UTI's are caused by E-Coli, taking this product on a regular basis will help you maintain a healthy urinary tract.,D-Mannose is a naturally occurring simple sugar, closely related (in chemical terms, a stereoisomer) to glucose. Small amounts of D-Mannose are metabolized by our bodies; more than small amounts are excreted promptly into the urine. But how can even large quantities of a simple natural sugar do anything at all to help maintain a healthy urinary tract? The answer is found in the interaction between D-Mannose and the bacterium found in over 90% of all bladder infections, Escherichia coli (E. coli).,An antibiotic kills unwanted micro-organisms, but it also kills many friendlymicro-organisms (kills the bad germs, and also the good ones). Long term or often repeated antibiotic use can lead resistant bacteria, to major disruptions in normal body microflora, and sometimes to major disruptions in health, especially immune system function. Use of D-Mannose is ecologically sound. The small amount of D-Mannose metabolized by the body and not excreted into the urine is harmless.","Helps maintain healthy urinary tract when taken on a regular basis,Prevents E.
