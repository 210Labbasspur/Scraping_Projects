difficult problem of positioning a weak or ""hemi"" hand on a
walker. There are many issues associated with hand weakness and
walker use. The hand can slip off the grip or slip out of
position, limiting the users ability to control the walker and
the amount of trunk support provided. Soft walker cuffs can't
hold a heavy hand securely in position and don't hold their shape
in the presence of mild to moderate flexor tone.

The Walker Hand Splint maintains proper wrist alignment and
provides weight bearing through the appropriate parts of the
hand. The criss-cross straps easily secure the hand in place and
can even be fastened by the user. The malleable aluminum core
allows the splint to be molded to fit most any hand and walker
grip. An adhesive hook and loop stip (included) is placed on the
walker grip to attach to the hook-sensitive surface of the

, is an unique new splint solves the
difficult problem of positioning a weak or ""hemi"" hand on a
walker. There are many issues associated with hand weakness and
walker use. The hand can slip off the grip or slip out of
position, limiting the users ability to control the walker and
the amount of trunk support provided. Soft walker cuffs can't
hold a heavy hand securely in position and don't hold their shape
in the presence of mild to moderate flexor tone.
,
The Walker Hand Splint maintains proper wrist alignment and
provides weight bearing through the appropriate parts of the
hand. The criss-cross straps easily secure the hand in place and
can even be fastened by the user. The malleable aluminum core
allows the splint to be molded to fit most any hand and walker
grip. An adhesive hook and loop stip (included) is placed on the
walker grip to attach to the hook-sensitive surface of the
splint, securing it in place. Comfortable, padded terry cover
keeps skin dry and protected. Removeable cover for easy
laundering. Hand wash with warm soap and water, air dry. One
size, choose Left or Right.

You can either use the scale with the display connected to the platform, (saves power) or use the display completely wirelessly with Bluetooth technology! When you're in wireless mode you need six batteries for the base and the included adapter for the display. If you want the ultimate in wireless, stick six batteries in the display, too, and take it up to 18 feet from the base. No power outlet needed! If you don't really need a wireless display, hook the display to the base with the included cable and you only need to power the display with either the included power adapter or six batteries. The PD750L has a whoppin' 18 inch by 14 inch platform. Before you spend your dough on this mighty scale, make sure you have room!,This bariatric scale has a USB port so ya can send your weight readings to your computer. This will save ya from having to write down your weights...the USB cable is even included! You won't have to worry about dust and dirt getting stuck under and around this obesity scale's buttons...The PD750L has an easy to clean membrane keypad with accurately labeled keys for easy weighing. To make sure ya get the most accurate weight readings from this high capacity scale, My Weigh designed the PD-750L with adjustable feet. So no matter where you're weighing you can make sure your scale is nice and leveled. The tare button on the PD750L weight display can be pressed to ""zero out"" the weight on the scale. You can then add more weight, and the display will only show the weight of the items you're adding.  If you ever have a problem with the PD750-L, just send it in to My Weigh's warranty center in Phoenix, Arizona.
