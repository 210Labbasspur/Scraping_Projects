A regular deep, thorough cleanse is fundamental in removing dirt and build-up from the scalp. If not removed, they can clog the hair follicles and affect shedding and hair growth. However, traditional clarifying shampoos can be a bit more drying and strip hair of its natural moisture. That's why Curlsmith created their Detox System in 3 steps: - The Primer creates a shield around the hair shaft, detangling and protecting its precious moisture. - The Wash & Scrub deeply cleanses and exfoliates the scalp, melting away all dirt & build-up. - The Calming Conditioner soothes and refreshes the scalp, leaving a tingly sensation and rebalancing moisture levels. Includes: - Super Slip Pre-Biotic Primer (12 oz) - Wash & Scrub Detox Pro-Biotic (8 oz) - Post-Biotic Calming Conditioner (12 oz) Benefits: - All-in-one kit - Doesn't strip the hair of natural moisture - Stimulates, clarifies and cools down the scalp - Deep but gentle cleansing routine - Protein-free  ","STEP 1: Wet your hair thoroughly and apply on the scalp before your shampoo, gently massaging it in. While the pre-biotics are working, make your way down the hair lengths, finger detangling until you get rid of all the knots. Do not rinse out.

					      ,CND Vinylux Weekly Polish makes it easy to get long-wear nail color right at home! Vinylux Weekly Polish uses a two part mechanism to create adhesion without staining the natural nail. The first part is the adhesion promoters in the color coat making the color self-adhering without a base coat. The second part is the fast drying formula which is designed to further lock in the pigments on a more permanent basis as the color layer forms a film. This stops any transport of the pigment down to the nail. Healthy nails without delamination or drying issues will maximize wear for one week. Vinylux Weekly Polish can be paired with the matching Shellac color for touch ups and toes.,The CND Vinylux Weekly Top Coat must be used with the Vinylux Weekly nail colors., CND Vinylux Weekly Top Coat has innovative Pro-light technology with photo initiators and becomes more durable with exposure to natural light.,Features:,- Long-wear color,- Self-adhering - no base coat needed,- Natural nails will not stain,- No lamp needed for curing,- Pair with matching CND Shellac colors for touch ups and toes,- ,Must be used with CND Vinylux Weekly Top Coat,

                ",Give yourself nails fit for a queen with this line of royal purple nail lacquers that boast long-lasting shine., CND Vinylux Weekly Polish makes it easy to get long-wear nail color right at home! Vinylux Weekly Polish uses a two part mechanism to create adhesion without staining the natural nail. The first part is the adhesion promoters in the color coat making the color self-adhering without a base coat. The second part is the fast drying formula which is designed to further lock in the pigments on a more permanent basis as the color layer forms a film. This stops any transport of the pigment down to the nail. Healthy nails without delamination or drying issues will maximize wear for one week. Vinylux Weekly Polish can be paired with the matching Shellac color for touch ups and toes. The CND Vinylux Weekly Top Coat must be used with the Vinylux Weekly nail colors. CND Vinylux Weekly Top Coat has innovative Pro-light technology with photo initiators and becomes more durable with exposure to natural light. Features: - Long-wear color - Self-adhering - no base coat needed - Natural nails will not stain - No lamp needed for curing - Pair with matching CND Shellac colors for touch ups and toes - Must be used with CND Vinylux Weekly Top Coat  ,Use VINYLUX as a System: start with Vinylux Color and always use Vinylux Weekly Top Coat.,,https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=www.beautybrands.com/product/cnd+vinylux+weekly+polish+-+purples.do&src=sdkpreparse,https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=CND Vinylux Weekly Polish - Purples&url=www.beautybrands.com/product/cnd+vinylux+weekly+polish+-+purples.do,610

When I m doing makeup, I always trace the brows softly at first as a starting point because they help me decide on a look. Then, after I finish, I decide if I want to go bolder to work with an architectural look or leave them more natural. How do you decide on a brow that works with your makeup? I don t think your brows should compete with the rest of your face, so I won t create a bold brow when I m doing a dramatic, smoky or smudged eye. Should I amp my brows up for night? Yes, for sure.
