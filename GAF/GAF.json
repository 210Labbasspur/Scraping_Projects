As I called around attempting to get quotes on insurance, I discovered that no one wanted to take a home with a tile roof that was over 15 years old. I was being forced into getting a new roof. I called two places to get quotes. Both quotes were within a few hundred dollars of each other. I decided to go with Schick because of the rave reviews my neighbor gave them. After my job was completed, I can understand why my neighbor was so impressed. The crew from Schick were all extremely courteous, very technically skilled, hard working, conscientious, and meticulous in their workmanship and clean up. It is difficult to put into words how impressed I was with them and the job they did for us.

They insist on only repairing the one panel, but the house was built in the 60s and this paneling is nowhere to be found according to their first subcontractor, Norman, and their second, Mario. Both stated, ON THEIR OWN, without any suggestion from me, that if the paneling could not be matched, the whole room's paneling would need to be replaced, so that it would all match, but Reliant has told them no, and that they need to build the paneling out themselves. Refer to the pictures of the repair to see how that turned out. Please keep in mind that through all of this Reliant has refused to return phone calls or emails. For every 5-10 voicemails or emails that my fiance or I leave we MAY get a response from reliant.

(Other company didn't handle gutters.) E.R. would be able to remove the gutters and replace them without waiting. Everyone we interacted with -- Justin mainly, Mike the job super, and Scott who took our down payment, as well as the crew themselves -- was very courteous, affable, and very understanding and patient. Justin made sure to sit and explain to us what they offered and what they recommended, and let my spouse and I make the firm decisions, and was fine with initialing a little change on the contract so that no one would think it an odd add-on. That was mostly for me as I have memory problems. Justin showed us the examples of the different roofing types they had on display in their office, so it was much easier to better understand the products (as well as see the colors). Justin & Mike were great at keeping in contact and us up todate, and they *listened* when I brought up minor concerns vs brushing me off. The crew themselves, in addition from having great taste in music, were again polite and courteous, as well as efficient. They were able to trim two downspouts so we could fit our rain barrels under them (which was part of the contract). They used tarps to catch the debris, and they did a fabulous job of cleaning up after. Absolutely no problems. In fact, E.R. was able to start the roof replacement a few days earlier than scheduled, which was a fantastic boon to us.

They stated they would call me back after doing so, but never called back. I called again today (1/11/2022) and said I was still waiting on my estimate and a call back, so they said they'd reach out to someone regarding the matter and have them call me back. Over 2 hours later, after not receiving a call back, I was finally emailed an estimate by Steve (While I question how an estimate was put together without coming to my home in person, I appreciate that an estimate was sent to me this time). I informed him that I would be pursuing alternative options for my roofing needs, and he politely informed me of the cause of the delays and apologized for the issues. Responsiveness leaves a lot to be desired, and the office staff seem to just not be very capable of consideration for potential clients.

And he answered our many questions, so we were comfortable with what needed to be done. True to their word, the very proficient and experienced crew arrived right on time and did a great job installing our entire roof.

Good service, I am pleased that I chose them for this job!\" by - J.L, May 24, 2023, \"I have a number of rental houses in Ocala I am selling. As you know, insurance and lenders want newer roofs. I contacted several roofers for estimates. Mr Terrell at Big D was right on it. The next day, I had a bid on the first house I needed reroofing. Other roofers took a week or more, Some never even contacted me. His bids were both competitive and reasonable. So far, they have done 5 of my homes. Crews are very hard workers. They sure seem to know what they are doing. 90 degrees, and working on a hot roof would kill me. They take great care to keep the area clean, placing protection over plants, grass, and items. All permits and inspections are done as required. So far, excellent jobs, I am very happy with their work. Hanna in the office has been very friendly and helpful as well.

Communication was great, my questions answered timely and clearly from beginning to end. The whole process took about 1 month. On the day of installation the workers showed up early, got set up and started promptly at 7am. They finished my 900 sqft house by 3pm, clean up and all (including damage repairs, which was more reasonable than I anticipated). They were efficient, worked hard and very courteous when I needed to let dogs out or when I had to come and go from home a few times throughout the day. I can't say enough nice things about a company taking so much of my money, but they earned it! And trust I'm telling everyone I know, including you, reading this! Call them right now, if you need a roof!\" by - A.B, May 25, 2023, \"Superior none! October 2018 this company was contracted for a new roof after Hurricane Michael. We had problems from the start with leaking of the roof. The roof was replaced and it started leaking in a few months after the second roof. Multiple complaints no help. Water damage done in house, warranty inspector said it needed to be replaced from ceiling to roof and everything including insulation. Roofing materials substandard and worn out after less than 5 years per inspector and other roofers. After years of complaints a warrant inspector showed up March 2023 and said it would be covered. I have called, showed up and texted Nick from Superior roofing and all I get is excuses and no fixing of this problem.

This caused concern for me and I called out Superior One roofing and a different roofing company to inspect my roof for repairs. Dexter was very professional and told me that there is nothing that needed repairs currently. This was also confirmed up by a different roofing company that inspected my roof. If I went with the original company that repaired my neighbors roof I would of been scammed. I really appreciate the honesty and due to this I give my full recommendation to this company it's being increasingly rare that a company is honest with their customers and don't try to take advantage.\" by - Z.S, Feb 12, 2023", "GAF_Rating": "", "No of GAF_Reviews": "", "GAF_Reviews": "", "Awards": "Single-Ply Roofer , This contractor specializes in installing Single-Ply roofing systems."},

They worked tirelessly and took very minimal time out for a bite to eat and were finished in a day and a half. But the company charged $4000 MORE THAN the $13,500 estimate for a 1000 sf house. I realized it would cost a bit more because they told me there was extra wood ordered at a cost of approximately $1000. I was told by Toni that they would let me know how much wood actually was used. I asked her TWICE what my final invoice would be and she never would tell me. I also asked twice to speak to Rich (owner?) and I was never allowed to speak to him. I expected to at least be treated with courtesy and respect and instead I received hurried, impatient responses from Toni whenever I attempted to communicate. I also expected an itemization of overages to validate how in the WORLD I paid over $17,000 for a roof and gutters. Incidentally, I also had to pay an additional $780 for some soffit work but the aluminum company was kind and respectful to me. So, all in all, over $18,000 project for a very small area. But, the worst part, was that I got no detailed explanation of where the monies were spent.. Sadly, I&rsquo;m sure it did not go to the crew who worked so hard to complete the job.Do your homework before hiring this company because you will pay through the nose. They were the most expensive of the estimates I received and only went with their estimate because Toni figured on extra wood.

I knew the owner of Fillingham Roofing & Sheet metal and they also worked on my roofs in the past. I found out they sold the business to Recovery Roofing Inc. I decided to give them a try after looking at their online reviews and their Better Business rating. They came out gave me a quote and worked with me while I secured approval from the home owners association. The roof as replaced in 2 days just like they estimated. There was a small issue the inspector found and they immediately corrected the problem and it passed the inspection. I even checked several times while it was raining to see if there were any leaks. They did a good job cleaning up. My roof looks great and I received a discount on my home owners insurance.

We have a very low pitch roof, and have had problems finding a roofer that understands this to be a roof that must meet strict requirements set by the state of Florida. Wanting a steel roof because of its durability and resale value here in Florida, we talked with Danny who walked us through the options we had. Domestic Design Roofing, more so Danny was able to inspect our old roof and determine what was needed, and more important work with material suppliers to find the better grade steel roofing at a cost we could afford. Jose the crew leader that worked on the house as well as his crew started work on the roof like a well oiled machine, replaced wood where needed, and installed the new steel roof within a few days. There work was outstanding taking there time to assure areas around the fireplace were constructed correctly, yet finishing the roof in such a fast pace we and our neighborhood homes owners were very impressed. The crew working on the roof were all very friendly, professional, and cleaned up after the work day every day. After the job was finished the crew did not even leave any evidence that they were ever even there except for a great looking new roof that will last us many years to come. Many of our neighbors in the area will be calling on Domestic Design Roofing for there new roof because of the great job Jose and his crew did on our home. We want to make sure the company recognizes the people we mentioned in this letter. Danny, Crew Leader Jose, and the hard working men in his crew. Thank you very much.

Thank you!\" by - E.W, May 1, 2023, \"The short version is the customer service with Stratus was nothing less than atrocious. Every step of the way WE had to initiate contact to move the process along. We had our quote September 19, signed the contract the following week knowing Hurricane Ian was coming. They said they would tarp our roof and they did not. But we were told we would be first in line after the hurricane since we had already been in contact about a new roof. Then, the following week we called to see what timeline we were looking at considering we knew the hurricane would delay things. We were told 3-4 weeks. With a lot of additional follow up in between - all from us, and not from Stratus unless we initiated it and escalated it to management, including having to give them the same information multiple times because they were not actually tracking it - our roofing began 8 weeks later. We were told it would take 2 days. It took 5. And then they ran out of materials so it continued to the following week. None of this was communicated to us by Stratus. One day a week later, we heard someone on the roof that we assumed was the inspector, but again, None of this was communicated to us. We finally had to call and speak again with a manager to even get a final bill so that we could simply be done with this company. We expressed our concern multiple times throughout the process, and There were barely apologies along the way and no attempt to make it right with any kind of discount, etc, whatsoever. We are glad to pay for work done so we didn&rsquo;t ask for it but thought with as horrendous an experience we had they might offer something. The only reason they get 2 stars is that the work appears to have been done well, But that is thanks to the subcontracted team from Gomez Construction who did the actual work. I cannot encourage you enough to steer clear of these folks. Otherwise you&rsquo;re going to be your own project manager to ensure your roof ever gets finished.\" by - M.C, Dec 29, 2022, \"We used Stratus Roofing after Hurricane Ian damage.

Done on time and exactly as promised!\" by - S.R, Jan 3, 2023, \"Robbie was in charge of this project from start to finish and went WAY above and beyond. We had roof damage after Hurricane Ian. In fact our insurance company sent a contractor out to tarp the roof and they did such a bad job that when it rained we were grabbing buckets and trash cans because the roof was leaking even tarped! As soon as I told Robbie they were the contractor we were going with he sent someone out to make sure we didn't have any more leaks because it was going to take a couple weeks to get the permit approved and the shingles and everything needed to do the job. After signing the paperwork and confirming everything Robbie made two separate trips to my house to drop off samples so my wife could pick the absolute perfect color for what she wanted. After everything was decided Robbie said it would be 7-10 days for the permit so we were playing the waiting game at this point. HOWEVER, again Robbie went above and beyond and two days later (a Thursday) called the Permit Office just to see where abouts we were and they said he was approved and moving forward! Instead of making us wait Robbie called and said they could start the following Monday!!! A full week sooner. The guys came out and knocked out the roof and kept me informed during the entire process. Sent me pictures of the wood that was being replaced and everything. I know for a fact my roof is solid and will be withstanding any storms for the years to come, which gives me superior comfort and peace of mind considering we took considerable interior damage due to the roof damage we took during Ian. I can't thank Robbie enough for his professionalism, prompt, and courteous service throughout the entire process.

Every step of the way WE had to initiate contact to move the process along. We had our quote September 19, signed the contract the following week knowing Hurricane Ian was coming. They said they would tarp our roof and they did not. But we were told we would be first in line after the hurricane since we had already been in contact about a new roof. Then, the following week we called to see what timeline we were looking at considering we knew the hurricane would delay things. We were told 3-4 weeks. With a lot of additional follow up in between - all from us, and not from Stratus unless we initiated it and escalated it to management, including having to give them the same information multiple times because they were not actually tracking it - our roofing began 8 weeks later. We were told it would take 2 days. It took 5. And then they ran out of materials so it continued to the following week. None of this was communicated to us by Stratus. One day a week later, we heard someone on the roof that we assumed was the inspector, but again, None of this was communicated to us. We finally had to call and speak again with a manager to even get a final bill so that we could simply be done with this company. We expressed our concern multiple times throughout the process, and There were barely apologies along the way and no attempt to make it right with any kind of discount, etc, whatsoever. We are glad to pay for work done so we didn&rsquo;t ask for it but thought with as horrendous an experience we had they might offer something. The only reason they get 2 stars is that the work appears to have been done well, But that is thanks to the subcontracted team from Gomez Construction who did the actual work.

Reliant came out to do a roof inspection, and found that area around my chimney had not been sealed well. I was still a happy customer, as they had completed the inspection and were going to come out and complete the repairs. They sent out Norman, a subcontractor who tried to complete the work in one evening. Please see all of the remaining pictures for his so-called repair. Reliant deemed this a successful repair. Are you kidding me??? I have been fighting with this organization since August of 2022. They insist on only repairing the one panel, but the house was built in the 60s and this paneling is nowhere to be found according to their first subcontractor, Norman, and their second, Mario. Both stated, ON THEIR OWN, without any suggestion from me, that if the paneling could not be matched, the whole room's paneling would need to be replaced, so that it would all match, but Reliant has told them no, and that they need to build the paneling out themselves. Refer to the pictures of the repair to see how that turned out. Please keep in mind that through all of this Reliant has refused to return phone calls or emails. For every 5-10 voicemails or emails that my fiance or I leave we MAY get a response from reliant.

Everyone we interacted with -- Justin mainly, Mike the job super, and Scott who took our down payment, as well as the crew themselves -- was very courteous, affable, and very understanding and patient. Justin made sure to sit and explain to us what they offered and what they recommended, and let my spouse and I make the firm decisions, and was fine with initialing a little change on the contract so that no one would think it an odd add-on. That was mostly for me as I have memory problems. Justin showed us the examples of the different roofing types they had on display in their office, so it was much easier to better understand the products (as well as see the colors). Justin & Mike were great at keeping in contact and us up todate, and they *listened* when I brought up minor concerns vs brushing me off. The crew themselves, in addition from having great taste in music, were again polite and courteous, as well as efficient. They were able to trim two downspouts so we could fit our rain barrels under them (which was part of the contract). They used tarps to catch the debris, and they did a fabulous job of cleaning up after. Absolutely no problems. In fact, E.R. was able to start the roof replacement a few days earlier than scheduled, which was a fantastic boon to us. We had to get the roof replaced and the final permit before June 7, something the city can make a bit difficult as they schedule inspections.

After the work was complete I had a GC friend of mine check over the work these people did. His words were short and concise, \" I would never use them\". So in 2020 we had a leak and it took no less then a dozen phone calls to get these people to come out, check the problem and correct it. We had to nag nag nag them for weeks. It was always the same story from the receptionist, \"All I can do is forward the message to the owner. I can't make him call you\". The owner eventually sent someone out there and they fixed the roof but, it took another 3-4 more months of nagging them to get a drywall guy to fix the mess with our ceiling from the leak. Fast forward to 2022-23, we have yet another leak and cannot get insurance for our house until this is fixed. And so here we are again with multiple phone calls over the last 2 months and once again the lady says, \"they owner will get in touch with you.\" And, so far, we cant get any callback or appointment to get this fixed! So while they were quick to take our money to install the roof, the after sales support from this company is piss poor. I highly advise you to NOT USE THIS COMPANY as you will not get a very good roof put on and you will not get a warranty that you can count on.

About the time the warranty went out (5 years) we started getting roof leaks. A roof like this should have lasted 10 or 15 years or more. They came out a time or two and then quit responding to my calls. I realize the warranty is up and I'm willing to pay for the repair and I tell them that when I call. Still no response. Service after the job is done is just as important as the job itself. Due to the roof not lasting long and the lack of response I'll never use them again.

Joseph - the salesman - came to my home and took video footage of areas that needed repair. He narrated the issues that needed to be addressed and explained the necessary procedures. Then, I was presented with a contract for $7,500 for repairing a approx. a dozen shingles and the opening of a \"vein\" on the top level to repair an area that might cause a leak in the future. Next, we went through the first page of the contract, and Joseph asked for my signature. I said, \"please let me look at your tablet, so I can see the entire contract.\" Well, I scrolled down to page 2 and read para.12 that stated in CAPS that their company would not be responsible for leaks, repairs, or any damages resulting from their work. So, I asked Joseph to call the owner (Tom), who was very pleasant, and said para. 12 was \"boilerplate language.\" So, I asked him to make a change to that paragraph and to guarantee the company's work for one a year (parts and labor). This included: 1) fixing any faulty workmanship, 2) repairing the same areas again that had been deficient, 3) being responsible (and paying for) all damages caused by leaks occuring ONLY in the areas where their work had been completed. Tom said that my concerns were reasonable and the contract could be amended to cover my concerns. Well, I haven't heard from the company since and even sent Tom (Pres.) an email asking where the revised contract was? No reply. Now, after reading the other one-star complaint on Yelp, I fully understand that this company does not stand behind its work and will not warranty the repairs paid for. The contract said that I would have to rely on the manufacturer's warranty. This is absolutely ridiculous since faulty workmanship, labor and damages are not the responsibility of the manufacturer. I do not recommend this company because they did not abide by their promise to amend the contract and take responsibility for the quality of their work. Meanwhile, I found another company with excellent reviews and no complaints who offered to complete the same job for $2,800. Suggestion to Tom: Next time just say that your company makes no changes to the contract instead of wasting everybody's time.\" by - B.S, Jun 22, 2023, \"THE BEST EXPERIENCE WITH BUSINESS IN SARASOTA.

In early April 2023, I was informed that the tear-off was scheduled for 4/10-4/11, tile install to follow. A few days later I received an email informing me that the price of my roof went up $9,000 due to \"material cost inflation\". The increase was approximately 30% of the original material cost. I was given a week or so to \"figure out what to do\". I checked with my son, a local general contractor, and 4 roofers regarding the increased cost of material. All agreed that material costs \"might\" have increased modestly over that time period, but certainly not 30% plus. Avery Roofing screwed me for profit, and gave me less than two weeks to figure it out, saying if I did not move forward NOW, I would lose the tile order and get set back another 6 months, waiting for tile. I fired them. If you choose to do business with Avery, two things: 1) Do not trust them on price and 2) make sure your contact knows what he/she is doing, ours did not.

They do not honor their 1 year warranty on workmanship, materials and systems. We overlooked a lot of defects and just plain poor workmanship when we purchased the new home. Baseboard paint was more on the floor than the baseboards. The painting is terrible, walls and baseboards. Kitchen island was crooked on one side and noted on walk through. Over 4 months later someone came out and caulked it, not correcting the issue but attempting to cover it up. When I discovered a hole in the flooring and reported it as a defect I was told it was owner damage and not covered. I did nothing to damage the floor and if I had I would have said I did. Basically, any defects an owner finds will be \"owner caused\" according to Seda. Seda has very poor customer service. The \"warranty\" department will ignore you hoping you just go away.

Take your business elsewhere and save yourself the frustration, disrespect, and unprofessionalism. After finding out that my funds had cleared from the insurance claim, they rushed me into a contract they would later use to threaten me after leaving out important verbal agreements. Without any notice, the materials were dropped off on my roof that next Wednesday for the roof to be done on Thursday as well as a dumpster that was left in my driveway for 6 days when I was told it would be picked up on Friday, the day after install. My pregnant wife, as a result, had to walk across the street to and from her parked car for 6 days. When the driver did show up, he blamed the roofing company for not calling him, and when I asked the roofing company, they blamed the driver. The biggest concern I had with my roof replacement was the ponding on my flat roofed Lanai. I expressed this to Dave (a co owner) and some lady who came to my house and offered limited colors and a shady contract. They verbally agreed that the flat roof would be taken care of. The day after installation, I went on the roof to inspect the work. I found excessive ponding and exposed wood between the drip edge and facia. I immediately tried to call, but of course, from this point on, they wouldn't answer 99% of my phone calls for the coming months. When they did finally answer, they attempted to excuse it as a \"structural\" issue and get out of any needed repairs. 2 weeks after installation, they finally came back out and re-roofed the flat roof to have less ponding and added metal flashing in areas where the wood was exposed but said I would have to pay for the extra materials? I was told by Dave that the materials would be picked up the next day by Jackson. Jackson was the same person who said the original dumpster would be picked up the following day, 2 weeks ago. To nobody's suprise, the flat roof materials remained in my front yard for almost 3 weeks. With the flat roof still ponding after 2 re-roofs, it was futile trying to reason or even contact these people. Another 2 weeks go by after many unanswered phone calls, and a lady by the name of Tommy calls me to apologize for all the inconveniences I've been dealing with. All I wanted at this point was to have an inspection scheduled and closed out so I can be done with this. Tommy scheduled the inspection for the following day. The inspector knocked on my door and said, \"Out of courtesy, I'm advising you I can not inspect the property because the inspection application wasn't filled out properly.\" A few more days and unanswered phone calls go by, and another co owner named Lucas reaches out to me. He meets with me at my property to collect those materials left in my front yard, that I moved into my garage after 3 weeks, and talk about all my inconveniences. For 30 minutes, we walk around picking up nails and debri left around my house 2 months after the original roof install while he apologizes over and over. Unknown to me, he was really just there to pick up the rest of the money. I told Lucas I wasn't comfortable giving them the final payment until the inspection and permit were closed out, proving a properly finished job. Lucas said ok, and after I asked if they would be willing to compensate me for all the trouble, I was offered a measly $500. I asked Lucas to do better and be better than that, but he said he would have to talk to Dave about it. Another week or two go by with no calls or answers until Tommy answers my phone. All I wanted to know was the status of the inspection, but she was more upset that I had already contacted the better business bureau for help in the matter and wrote an honest review about my experiences. As well as accusing me of refusing to pay, she said that they are a busy multi-million dollar company and can't answer phone calls or show up on time. I offered to give them the check the following day, and to no suprise, they took back their $500 compensation because I left a bad review on BBB.

My roof was installed at the end of March and the rain is leaking through it at the beginning of July.

I called and the supervisor did come and said that this happens it's not a problem. There were nails on the ground everywhere and I picked some up and I said the old nails are about an 1 inch long but the new nails are about 2 1/4. Is this not going to make holes all over the roof? He assured me that they used the right nails but the problem was only that roofers cannot see where they are nailing through the roof but this was normal to have holes and it's not a problem. When rain started falling through my new roof I called that supervisor and was told I just got this phone so I'll send your request to another office. When I called the office I was told I'll try to find someone who can address your concerns but they didn't. Later I got a callback and was told we'll try to send a tech next week. I await that response while the rain falls through my roof and the roof I thought would last for years is leaking in just a couple months Beware and don't use Rainfall roofing.
