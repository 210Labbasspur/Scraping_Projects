The crew sent out caused damage to my patio table set by dropping a roofing tile and shattered my glass. The crew threw spiked pigeon barrier on my driveway and we drove over it luckily no tire damage there. The crew threw material from the roof breaking lower roof tile and stuff being thrown in my pool. Owner Bryan Brown stated he was going to replace the table and because my table ins't available and the cheapest replacement I could find online was in the $500 range plus tax and shipping. He offered me $400 instead. I wasn't happy taking a loss but asked when I would be paid I was told a check the next day and someone would also be fixing my broken tile they damaged at the same time. Then as usual no call no show 2 days later I reach out and I'm told check in the mail and they are so slammed someone will be out next week to fix damage. After not receiving check I reach out to owner who now says check was sent yesterday which was 3 days later than my 3 text messages state it was confirmed as sent. Because I was upset and expressed my dissatisfaction the owner stated \"who do I think I am? Nobody talks to him like that because he has bent over backwards and is paying me more than my table is worth\" He has accused me of berating his company, he has reached out to a non related air conditioning company doing work in my home and stated everyone is on his side. Nobody cares about my complaints. He threatened with lawyers on retainer, told me to cease and desist yet called me 3 times and sent me 3 harassing messages. Said I'm an untruthful person because I didn't have my house sold(I have a buyer contract to prove) I also have a recorded call with investor backing out because the roof damage. He stated I'm just not a good individual and that's the facts he's going to tell everybody. I am a disabled person who is currently undergoing medical treatments and suffer panic and anxiety disorder. I didn't do anything but expect this company to DO WHAT THEY SAY.

OVERALL 2 STARS. On 22 Aug 22, I reached out to Windows and More for an estimate on gutter replacement due to wind damage.

I was a bit unsure of the technical qualifications as she seemed unsure of the task at hand and not very confident. On the 24th I met with VP Sales #1 and the Sales Mgr (?) to finalize the contract. My insurance claim did not cover a portion of the damage so a supplemental claim was to be submitted. The estimated timeline was 8 weeks which was fine. On or about 20 Sep 22, I reached out to VP Sales #1 to check on the progress of the supplemental submission...\"All good- and it was here job to keep me informed.\" In early Oct, I contacted my insurance company, no supplemental had been received. Visited office and was assured it was; but, I asked to see what was sent...discovered incorrect email address. I sent supplement to insurance company--rejected two days later due to insufficient documentation. Sales Mgr said he'd send another rep out for better pictures. VP Sales #2 arrived next day and seemed a bit more confident/competent. He informed me he'd be in touch...never heard from him again. Week of 24 Oct, I visited office again...revised supplemental to be submitted by 31 Oct. Contacted insurance company on 4 Nov, no new supplemental received, I forwarded the \"revised supplemental\"...rejected again week of 7 Nov. Note, I'm the one following up with both Windows and More and the insurance company. Visited office again, strongly expressed my desire to proceed with the work, forget the supplement and let's move forward and wrap this relationship up. Note, I did defer other gutter work on another structure in order to complete the work on my primary residence. Install Tech was super /5 star and very helpful on how to proceed.

Still trying to get them to finish up just the small things like back door, to sealing the spaces from not measuring the cuts, fascia. and still have not completed the job. Can't get a itemized statement - it appears they have charged items that they did not do. And repeatly asked for this itemize statement.

My roof went from what I thought was going to be a small fix into a full roof replacement. This is no fault of theirs as it is an old roof. First they came over and did what they could for the roof informing me I needed a replacement and not just a quick fix. The work they did complete however did not look good as all of the roofing tiles they worked with are not straight. Even though it was more of a temporary fix I still expect it to look at least somewhat professional. They said they would roll the temp fix expense into the price of a roof replacement. This is when they disappeared on me. They did not return my calls or emails even after I told them I would like to work with them. Instead I had to start the process over with an entirely different company. They did the temp fix in January and made me pay half up front. Today more than 3 months later they sent me the second half of the bill without saying or asking anything. Not giving me an opportunity to roll the price into the real fix due to ignoring me I have lost money on just a temporary fix with this company.\" by - R.B, Apr 17, 2023, \"Ryan McDaniels and West Coast Roofing did an absolutely excellent job in repalce the roofing system (shingles and membrane) on our large church buildings.
