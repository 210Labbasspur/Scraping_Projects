Highly recommend!!!!\" by - S.C, Jun 21, 2023, \"We decided to get vinyl siding and new gutters on our house. Mike showed up within a few days and gave us such a great estimate we decided to have the deck replaced as well. All work was done within 2 weeks and we literally did not have one issue with any of it. His team did a great job including leaving our yard spotless when they were done. We now receive many compliments about our house. We highly recommend Mike for this kind of work.\" by - L.S, Jun 20, 2023, \"My mom called to have an estimate for our roof & Mike came out and checked the roof out, within a few days he had an estimate for her, he was so nice and very professional.
