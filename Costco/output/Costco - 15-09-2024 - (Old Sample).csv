This versatile baking set offers best-in-class baking performance with the flexibility to store and transport foods while keeping them fresh.

It’s ideal as a holiday roasting pan for turkey too. The classic half sheet is a kitchen staple for ingredient prep, baking and serving. A see-through lid is included and fits over the rim of both pans for storage of baked goods.

Once you use them, you’ll understand why uncoated natural sheet pans are an indispensable classic in both professional and home kitchens alike. Proudly American-made by Nordic Ware, a family-owned business since 1946.
